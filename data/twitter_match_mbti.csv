उसी क्रम में कोरोना कालखंड में भी प्रदेश की 119 चीनी मिलों का संचालन किया गया।

यही नहीं किसानों को ₹1 लाख 12 हजार करोड़ के गन्ना मूल्य का भी भुगतान किया गया है। यह उत्तर प्रदेश में एक रिकॉर्ड है।","पिपराइच एवं मुंडेरवा चीनी मिल में सल्फरलेस प्लांट के लोकार्पण की पूर्वी उत्तर प्रदेश के सभी किसान भाइयों को हार्दिक बधाई।

यहां से तैयार रिफाइंड शुगर बड़े-बड़े होटलों, चिकित्सालयों, दवा कंपनियों और अन्य स्थानों में प्रयोग होगी।

यह पूर्वी उत्तर प्रदेश को नई पहचान प्रदान करेगा।","राजस्थान के जिला परिषद एवं पंचायत समिति के चुनावों में @BJP4Rajasthan को प्राप्त विजय की राजस्थान भाजपा के हर कार्यकर्ता को हार्दिक बधाई।

यह जनकल्याण की भावना की जीत है।","जनपद गोरखपुर की पिपराइच इकाई में स्थापित 5,000 टी.सी.डी. क्षमता की नई चीनी मिल में सल्फरलेस प्लांट का लोकार्पण... https://t.co/hXXlbOyXDu","निष्पक्ष एवं पारदर्शी व्यवस्था के द्वारा ""हर हाथ को काम"" का संकल्प उ.प्र. में पूरित हो रहा है।

आमजन के जीवन और स्वास्थ्य से खिलवाड़ का यह प्रयास कतई स्वीकार्य नहीं होगा।","आज भारत बंद का समर्थन कर अराजकता फैलाने वाले कांग्रेस समेत अनेक दल यह बताएं कि वर्ष 2010-11 के दौरान जिस यूपीए सरकार ने APMC एक्ट में व्यापक संशोधन की वकालत की थी और राज्यों के मुख्यमंत्रियों को इससे संबंधित पत्र लिखे थे, आखिर उस समय उन्होंने यूपीए सरकार का समर्थन क्यों किया था?","श्री मुलायम सिंह जी ने 2019 में कृषि से संबंधित स्टैंडिंग कमेटी में एपीएमसी मॉडल एक्ट में संशोधन को ""किसान हितैषी"" बताते हुए उसका समर्थन किया था।

फिर आज यह राजनीतिक दल भारत बंद का समर्थन किस मुंह से कर रहे हैं, इसका जवाब इन्हें देश की जनता को देना होगा।","मूल्यों व आदर्शों के बगैर राजनीति कभी जन विश्वास का प्रतीक नहीं बन सकती है।

वह सभी राजनीतिक दल, जिन्होंने कृषि संबंधी सुधार के इस महत्वपूर्ण कदम का सत्ता में रहते हुए समर्थन किया था, अपने इलेक्शन मेनिफेस्टो का हिस्सा बनाया था, आज उसका विरोध कर जन विश्वास पर कुठाराघात कर रहे हैं।","यूपीए सरकार में कांग्रेस व उसके सहयोगी दलों ने किसानों को हमेशा हथियार बनाया लेकिन किसान हित में कोई भी कदम उठाने में सदैव संकोच करते रहे। यह उनके दोहरे चरित्र को दर्शाता है।

यह दल आज भी भोले-भाले किसानों के कंधों पर बंदूक रख कर देश में अराजकता फैलाने का प्रयास कर रहे हैं।","केंद्र सरकार ने किसानों के हित में कृषि संबंधी सुधारों से जुड़े महत्वपूर्ण विधेयकों के माध्यम से पिछले 06 वर्षों में अनेक क्रांतिकारी कदम उठाए हैं।

किन्तु देश के कुछ राजनीतिक दल भोले-भाले किसानों को भ्रमित कर वातावरण खराब करने का प्रयास कर रहे हैं।",ISTJ

Nothing worldly will shake or affect you that you lose your sense of self. You’ll have inner peace. You won’t be easily provoked. You’re better able to control your anger. You’re calm in the face of adversity!","RT @Abdullahaiduk: WINTER WARMTH APPEAL!

And it’s certainly a preparation for when the door finally opens. It’s all to do with timing. The Lord of the Worlds knows when it’s best to give you what you’ve been asking for day and night!,"At times, the Almighty will slow you down just to protect you. A delay doesn’t mean denial. There’s evil ahead of you which you can’t see but He can. So don’t always be in a hurry. Read His signs. You’ll be forever grateful that you didn’t rush headlong into things. Slow down!",Learn to be fair. The Almighty loves those who are just. Sometimes you don’t like someone based on what others have said about him or someone else's description of him.

He knows what’s in your heart even before you uttered it!","We often forget who’s in control of our journey. We plan as if everything is guaranteed. As if we’ll get everything we want. But the Almighty has shown us, especially during this pandemic that we should appreciate everything that we have. He can take away anything, anytime!","Learn to wait patiently. Not with a bad attitude. When you see friends being blessed, be happy for them. Pray for their well-being so the Almighty might grant you the same favours. Your turn will come. Live by this principle: when it wasn’t my turn, I never hated. I just waited!","Feel hopeless? Feel like the world is caving in on you? Feel like you’re in total darkness with no light at the end of the tunnel? Remember, no matter what you’re going through, that one sincere prayer can change your entire life. Where there’s hope, there’s life. Always!","The greater the obstacles, the greater the victory. Don’t complain when your test is a difficult one. The Almighty tests those He loves most. He’ll keep testing us. There’s a purpose behind the trial. Tests are a way to purify us. Embrace it. You’ll realize its value eventually!","How you live your life daily matters. Are you sowing seeds of goodness so you can reap them later or are you doing whatever you feel like. Don’t waste your short time in this world. Sow seeds of positivity, gratitude, love, hope etc and see how it impacts those around you.","Almighty. Forgive us for trying to fix things on our own. Forgive us for running around seeking help when we should be turning to You. Forgive us for forgetting how much we need You above everyone &amp; everything else. You know our pain, burden &amp; cares. Heal us. Make us whole again!","Let’s be honest about it. From time to time, we all do foolish things. We make mistakes.
