No, I absolutely wasn't. That was me bringing my own age into it and asking if that may have something to do with it. :) That's interesting and it does actually scare me since I like who I was...
It would definitely help. Maybe I'll go for a walk since I don't have a license to drive myself anywhere. ha! Another amazing fact.
I mean it in literal terms. I don't own my own home. What do you mean becoming someone else? I am going on 26. You think this is semi age associated too?  I feel like I'm too young to be crabby.
Thanks, friend.
I'm aggravated.  I don't even feel like writing this.  The idea of having to explain myself is exhausting to me and I don't want to spend a lot of time trying to get other people to understand...
Never-mind..  You wouldn't understand.

I'm in the same boat right now. I actually came on here to vent and I saw your post.  I haven't reached total breakdown yet, though I have in the past. I'm so very close though. I can usually...
I think you're right :)
I heard this out & I don't think you understand my perspective. But I expected that so I'm not even mad. As far as being a real INFJ. I'm not even going to indulge in that. That would just be awkward...
Can't say I agree
I do PLENTY of useful things :)    Original poster? Not sure, but okay.
Are you black or mixed?
Okay, so not ACTUALLY! Because I'm very connected to my white-ness :) But now that I have your attention, I'm actually going to talk about this topic.  As INFJ's, we tend have problems relating...

Hello everyone.  As an avid D&D player, I felt a need to share this dice shaming picture.  I would create my own if I had not abandoned my traitorous, speckled d20 so long ago.
Life is quite lovely right now. <3
My internet connection is being piss-poor, but other than that, things are going fairly well.  How are you guys?
Hello. c:
Lurking.
Yes.
Good evening/morning.
Doing well. Happier than before.  Hello, Infinnacage.
Hello, Hakase.  How are you today?
I tend to visit at deserted hours.  Thus my old joke of being the thread's night watchman.
I am happy to be anticipated. c:
Well, I'm glad things haven't exploded in my absence, that would be a shame to miss.  I'll attempt to peek in more often.
Thank you.  And I've just been wandering. It is as I am.  How have you people in the thread held up?
Would someone please fire the torpedoes?

I have been waiting a long time to see Gamzee actually die.

Jon had his good moments. Most if not all of which have fanimations now.  My favorite series with Danny is when they play Ribbit King. I love watching them play a round of Frolf. <3
The ending was wonderful!  The most recent Table Flip with Markiplier was great as well.   I liked Jon, but yes, at times he would be too much and at other times the show would grow dull. I like...
Your recognition of a wonderful production makes me smile. c:
This image makes me laugh: 
That's the second time I've seen that gif today.  I love it.
I'm not currently interested in that other thread.

Yaaaay!  A much more productive way to go, isn't it?  INFP, the way you quest for answers, and refuse to settle inspires me.
The rule of this thread goes against my principles, so I won't comply. INFP, I like where your P takes you, it takes you to open windows, and ignores open doors.
Me too.  I don't like type casting people.  They are all unique.  I think your icon is perfect by the way.

Tarantulas are actually venomous, not poisonous! :) (That is your semi-useless distinction of the day.) I feel the Chilean Rose is very INTP like in a number of ways - they are laid back, well-liked,...
How could anyone hate these cute little guys? They are so tiny, and harmless to humans, too! Plus, they are great at catching and eating bugs that do harm us, such as flies, mosquitoes, and even...

Threads about killing spiders make me sad... :( If I were in that situation, I'd leap to save the spider, and then do my best to educate people on spiders. Most people fear what they don't understand...
There's a 99% chance you have a tumblr, haha. Welcome, Lotty.
Hello Pataki! I loved Hey Arnold growing up, and I'm assuming you did, too. :) Welcome to the forums!
You're gorgeous! Do you like tarantulas, too? I'm really into avicularia versicolor and avicularia metallica. (The pink toes, they get to me!)
Very true! For me, I thought I was a thinker type at first as well, especially for my tendency to withdraw into my mind and ruminate over my things. Little did I know the main way I was thinking...
So many lovely INFJs in this thread! I love to put a face to a name, so here are some pics of me prior to discovering the joys of the roundbrush + blowdryer, haha. (I'd take new ones, but I've always...
Faiora: Very well said and insightful.
I very much agree with this sentiment - for some reason, I've always felt hampered by labels. The second you slap a label on the relationship is the moment I feel smothered and uneasy. I just like...

Poor bugs, they are so misunderstood! I just adore them, especially spiders. Just look at these sweet little guys: ...
I'm admittedly not too familiar with ISTJs, but it sounds like perhaps he needs some space to sort out his emotions? Perhaps he was silent because he didn't know how to respond, because he's unsure...
I'd take it slowly and cautiously; I think trust is something that must be built and earned. It has to grow and continually be nourished throughout the course of the relationship, it's not something...
For me personally, a good bit of what is in my head thankfully does get out there - but I have the INFJ trait of holding back a lot of aspects of myself, and perhaps the true depths of how feel; only...
This is a helpful post for me - I'm someone who tends to retreat into the safety of my inner world far too often. Thanks for the good advice. I'd like to be better about actualizing what is floating...
Going with your analogy - I think the trauma can be repaired, but it's never again like the original mechanism. There's some patch or additional valve or extension tube or lever that helps repair -...

Now I'm even more charmed and enamored with you guys - half of it is the adorable self-depreciating humor, and half of it is that we INFJ savor the chase. Show yourselves, elusive INTPs! <3

I really love spiders, especially salticidae (jumping spiders) and tarantulas. :)

I think you have every right to be frustrated - I think this can be a very negative aspect of the INFJ nature, and for me personally, a big flaw of mine that I need to work on. I'm really glad you...
I can understand this - this is a very valid criticism. I have a tendency to go into phases where I retreat from the world and my loved ones, and this has often hurt them quite deeply. I can be very...
I dated an ENFJ, and while it was emotionally intense and flowers and rainbows at first, it fizzled out fast. I found him to be sweet at first, but later, to be very insincere. He had a tendency that...
I feel you - it's why I gave up pages ago. At this point he's just projecting his own personal issues onto us.
First of all, can I say that you sound so sweet and wonderful? My heart feels all mushy and gooey just reading about your feelings for her. :) You seem so genuine and sincere. I'm truly rooting for...

helllloooo. I know the feel of being an extraverted introvert so don't worry, you are not alone. Welcome to the forums :)
Living life to the fullest would naturally mean different things to different people. If it means chilling listening to music and reading then hell yeah go do it. I, however, am an INFJ who loves...
Lies ! ESTPs can't exist on the internet ! Internet is for Introverts! :tongue:  Welcome though, always a pleasure to have another crazy ESTP with us.
Welcome to our crazy land :) The more INTJs the merrier.
Guilty as charged haha. I'll type out the entire thing then I'll be like ...wait...why am I even saying all this?   DELETE. Hell, I was half tempted to delete this xD
Hey that's kinda like me! Except I'm an INFJ but type like   Ni Se/Fe Fe/Se Ti ,  Instead of Ti auxiliary and Se inferior. Hybrids ftw lol.
Story of my life
Welcome welcome :), my best friend is an INFP. you guys are crazy but I love you :happy:
You are aware that Si is the very last function in the INFJ stack right? Ni Fe Ti Se Ne Fi Te Si i.e it is your most unconscious function, which would mean that you are never aware when you use it...
I don't understand their perspective so I can't love it or hate it.
Long story short, Can't go from J to P because that would mean all your functions magically changed (Congrats on your psychosis btw). Also INTJ = Perceiving Dom while INFP = Judging Dom. etc etc.
Happy birthday man, hope it's going well. If you somehow get on here before the day is over, just remember to take everything as it comes. Do the best you can with the opportunities you get. Have fun!
Sounds like the story of how I got on here lol, welcome my friend. I know how you feel, wish I could just find one other INFJ in real life. Oh well, I guess that's what I get for being an INFJ in the...
Protector of those who cannot protect themselves. Or maybe I just have too much Fe for an INFJ.
Another INFJ with an ISFJ mom here. Yeah they don't get Ni and Si probably annoys the living daylights out of you, but it's all about just being a bit above functions and what not. Just understand...
I recommend Vivaldi be removed from the INFJ list since there is 0 evidence. Still want to know who made that conclusion to begin with.
Hai newbie :D . Have a nice stay here in our asylum...I mean forums.
Lol at your next party just jump up on stage and wiggle it. They'll invite you to every party then on. For me , people think I'm quiet, then when I go to parties and I'm pwning the dance floor...
Life without pepsi...must be tough.
Time to end the great debate once and for all. Pepsi or Coke?
Lol'd , *Adds this to the to-do list for April 1st 2014*
Only have one confirmed ENFJ that I actually hang with, and it's usually pretty fun. Get along easily. Probably because I'm more in touch with Se than an INFJ is supposed to be :P
I'd slap you. :happy:
You should type by cognitive functions instead of letters 'cause introverted sensing and extraverted sensing definitely aren't the same 'S'.  But that's not why I came to this thread. Just came to...

They don't count as 'saying yes' would require that they actually had the option to begin with.:happy:
OOh it's an ENTP! I call dibs.
Well I haven't found one myself so it would seem that the INFJ doesn't even know where to find an INFJ. I am at school,at some club/charity as a volunteer,hanging with friends at a mall or cinema. ...
What kind of sick monster wouldn't say yes to cheese ? :shocked:
Once again don't know if my joke was misunderstood still (since that's the way most of you seem to be replying)  but in case you didn't realize, I am very well aware that extraverts do not fall into...

Really, what are you extraverts doing on forums instead of being out partying? I'm honestly curious.
 :kitteh:
Oh yes I'm aware of the complexity of the problem. But it is of the highest priority to me because it seems to cause the most suffering.   I would love to see the end of all those things as well...
Poverty is my topic of interest. Have no idea what I'm going to do about it, but I'm going to do something. What about you?
Is this how a world of ENFJ's would look?   *runs back into introvert hole*
Warm welcome to you friend. Sounds like you joined for a very good reason and I can tell you that you will most certainly find what you're looking for and more. Enjoy your stay :)
Welcome Amber :). If I were you I'd steal one of their jets and fly it to the moon, where I would peacefully live out my remaining 5 minutes of existence. But then again, I'm just a stupid teenager....'
'I find that poster and your facial expression, along with the fact that you are INTP, so ironic. Lmao. 10/10 points
I can definitely see how this happens. I used to do this too and jump to false conclusions. But I think once the function and the individual mature and develop, this becomes less of an issue. This...

The Fi and Fe clash is real.

Alphonse from Full Metal Alchemist Lindsey Lee Wells from An Abundance of Katherines :proud:  And Justin from Let's Be Cops. Did anyone watch it yet? I thought he was so INFJ.
It's simple. Well, no it's not. But I think it's because individual acts of selfishness are rewarded in society. And those rewards are usually tangible which makes all the difference in the world....

Hmm, I see what you mean. Well, I didn't develop those websites so I don't have control over that. I merely described what they are. The incentive for the first one is that it's venting. The music is...

Hi Aim,  I think you do lead with your Feeling function.  That's been consistent in both Cognitive function tests and in your original post.  Can you talk about why you related more to Si/Ne?

Yeah, I think the desire to create art can stem from any function, you just see a difference of motivations involved.  Ni-doms and Fi-doms are driven to explore art as expression of their internal...

ENTP  ENFP  INTP...
ENTJ  ENFJ  INTJ...
This should go without saying, but no offense is intended by any of these.  It's all in good fun:  ESTP...
^ This (with the exception of enjoying sitcoms; I generally find them to be tacky :-P).  Trust me, I'm about as introverted as they come, but also undoubtedly a SO dom.  More specifically, being...
Possibilities for 147:   ...
Glad to know I'm not the only one that picked up on some of his annoyances.  People like to portray him as having immaculate patience, but seriously, in modern vernacular he'd be like OMFG, when is...
Prior to reading this response I was planning on going into detail regarding Jungian archetypes and whatnot, as well as encourage you to examine what is currently going on in your life in order to...
This all reminds me of another thread awhile back:  Promethea's response pretty much sums up how I feel...
This thread is becoming all kinds of awesome:  Nerdy CoD talk - check INFJ Man-Love - check INTJ disturbed by INFJ Man-Love - check Classic INTJ shameless self-promotion - check  (Pulls up...
I'm chillin' in Antarctica...   cuz that's just how I roll.  (P.S. Anybody want to come visit me?)
One word: YES :tongue:  As for why, that can depend a lot on the situation and/or the persons involved.  In a nutshell, it has to do with being really careful not to hurt other peoples feelings. ...
Well, seeing as how I live in SD, making it should be no problem. :happy:  Count me in!  (Just don't count on me wearing purple...)
Yup.  Only an INFJ would be backwards enough to repeatedly run away from a palace full of treasures and concubines to contemplate the suffering of the world :crazy:
1w2 male INFJ's are rare?  How do you figure?
Yeah, I started analyzing philosophers by cognitive function preference after a discussion in my 'Modern Philosophy' class regarding the role of family background, temperament (in a general sense of...
There's a really strong internet consensus that Plato was INFJ, and my own reading of him leaves little to no doubt of that in my mind.  His Fe is most apparent in 'The Republic' when he compares the...
Probably the best way to get in touch with Se is to meditate.  Of course, it isn't the meditation itself that is stimulating Se, but that doing so quiets down our overactive Ni enough that we can...
Damn, you beat me to it!  :frustrating:    Guess the only thing I have to add is that the INFJ condition of feeling misunderstood (though being Type 4 is probably a contributor too) and the general...
ohTOMICho, this wisdom was bestowed upon me after some crazy antics of mine went down in another thread.  I feel the time has come to pay it forward...  ...
Hey man, I've kept an eye out on these folks, but I still haven't seen them typed (except for Spielberg, though some claim he reported himself to be ISFP, others say he's ENFP, so I dunno).  Wish I...
Random results is right, but it was still helpful!  It's funny, because I remember a thread from a long time ago about 'INFJ Mascots' and how I wished ours was a Phoenix instead of a dolphin; so I...
Sooooo, when is this thread gonna be stickied? :mellow:
Good timing on this thread, cuz I was actually thinking of changing my avatar soon :shocked:  I'm open to suggestions...  (P.S. Aspera, your new 'avie' is awesome!)
Just gotta say, I love yall's nerdiness!  I feel right at home in this thread :proud:  Games: Zelda, Zelda, Zelda (I just love me some Zelda) Metroid Prime Trilogy Left 4 Dead (1 and 2) Halo...
Hey Karyssa :happy:  Daveman is right, the numbers don't mean that much in the end; it's all about the cognitive functions: ...
Confirmed = Non-Contraversial :wink:
We most certainly can and do make great philosophers (especially those who have a well developed Ti).  Ni is where it's at for seeing the big picture, then Fe channels our focus towards those...
What this thread has turned into:    On a more constructive note, I think Cedric Diggory was ISTP (and a total BAMF at that).
Oh, is that what they call it these days? :tongue:  And Nottie, I AM winning, but not without considerable detriment to my own sanity :crazy:
I don't know whether or not you're including me in the group of people whom you think implied SJ's blindly follow tradition.  If so, then you misunderstood me and I feel I should clarify things a...
Too late, I'm already on a drug.  It's called... Charlie Sheen!
Speaking of 'dirtius thougticus lobes,' didn't it sound like that dude was getting off to the double rainbow... or was that just me? :unsure:
Perhaps the better question is: how are we not weird? :dry:  I say that in jest, however, there's a good deal of truth to it.  If it were possible to boil down our uniqueness to just one source it...'
