I was fine academically. Hated things where I had to memorize. Kids were usually mean to me in elementary/middle school. By highschool I took more courses that were math-y and didn't need to much...
I am introvert and I am offence
close this thread already omg
You'd be surprised.   Going through your other posts, I gathered you were treated like shit and betrayed by the people you were supposed to trust. I've been too and have developed mental disorders...
Clearly all those things people say are said because they don't understand that not everybody thinks like them. They don't understand what depression does to a person. Hell, I don't even understand...
I originally typed as INTJ and it took a lot of reading and internal debates to get INFJ of the two.   I'd get frustrated but not at them. I'll continue to help them because I understand how it's...
And yes I have. My most recent was 5w6, 9w8, 3w2
The functions I see in you are fe, si, ti, and ne. So I understand why you typed as an isfj. But I don't agree with the stack since you don't seem to be aux fe. Maybe you're ti > ne > si > fe? INTP?...
Unsure on my brother and sister but I'm pretty sure my dad's istp and mom isfj. Will confirm when they finally give into taking the test :p
I shut my mouth and don't argue with them. Keep the peace :laughing:
Actually I've been developing Fe a lot lately. I used to be really indifferent to others and in my own head more. A day dreamer more than anything. So much that my elementary school teachers thought...
I get where you're coming from when you say I use si but all the cognitive tests say my si is very low. And isfj say that laws are there because they work. I don't believe that. Others believe that...

Can you link it here? In your original post preferably so others who see this can see it and can type you
Egad! Not another INFP!! :laughing:  Welcome to PerC!
For someone who's loves getting the most possible info, you sure don't give much  I kid, I kid. But seriously questionnaire pls ty xxx
Dreamer777 if you're still down for typing me :p
I type myself as an INFJ but am still pretty doubtful. When I originally took the MBTI I typed as INTJ. Then on my second go INFJ. Related to both pretty much a lot but some of the INFJ stuff were...
Lol'd.   But OP you do seem more like like a infj. Intj's don't usually account others in their decision making. And the logical reasoning of feelings thing you mentioned is a ti thing.
This questionnaire didn't really bring it out. But I do think I have a fair bit of Ti because I get into the ni-ti loop a lot (apparently it's more in developed ti) and the things im good at are more...
I used to get bored when I was little (who doesn't) and I would replay movies in my head - by replay I mean take the theme, some key points and make up everything in between. Then I'd get in trouble...
I had my doubts from the description to the functions and everything I knew from INTJ basically and that was the first thing that made me seriously rethink. Sounds silly I know. I guess I thought...
Anything. For example I'm pursuing a degree in engineering because I plain like making things. (and I grasp math/physics well :p) But a lot of types of engineering aren't exactly people orientated...
Jobs that involve making or creating things. Or thinking of ways to make things work better. But at the same time I'm keeping people in mind and how these creations will help them
Yep, especially with music. Unless I know that it's within their taste in that case I'll blast that song and play the entire album while I'm at it. :p Kinda easy to figure out what they like too...
Considering we have yet to discover most of the universe, there's no way in hell we are alone
I actually used to type as INTJ. Then I went through the INTJ forums and, well, reevaluated.
Doubt it. Too cold for Fe dom lol. I like helping people and all that stuff but it really doesn't reflect in my day to day life unless there's a time where someone really needs it. I guess I...
Exaggerated maybe? It happens with cognitive function tests sometimes. Retaking it usually helps in leveling it out.  INFP would be my second guess.  Retake the test, or take the PerC one...
YES. Nobody understands when I tell them but it helps me concentrate in a way. I call it a pre-distraction - It acts as background music when I'm focused on the reading and I can listen to it when my...
At gatherings I would find a wall to myself and try to stand on my head o_o I would do this rather than playing with the other kids. The entire time.  I used to eat paper and dirt from flower pots...
ESTJ. 75 I versus E, 80 N versus S, 60 F versus T, and 60 J versus P  Almost the exact opposite hm
Definite Ti use. Saw some N but not sure if it was Ni or Ne (most likely Ne because of your test results). Saw some F but funeral thing suggests you use more Fi than Fe (Fe user would absorb...
No problem! Let's see if the others who helped out agree though they seem to have a lot more experience typing people than I do :p    Thanks, I'll need it :$! TP's are known to be good engineers...
Yep, deffs Si :p. Reflective stuff is Fi but also can be Ti. Hey, I'm in engineering too! Well, starting this fall haha  Brainstorming is an Ne thing. The ability to jump from one idea to another...
Yeah to me you're definitely Ne-Si. Two outta four - yes! For the others I'm still thinking you're Fe and Ti. Then again I'm Fe-Ti so I tend to see it a lot in other people :p  As for INFJ I see...
Yeah scratch out INTP then. When I read mine (Se inferior for intj/infj) it basically described my life lmao. And I don't even 100% relate to infj or intj!     You possibly can be an E. Maybe Si...
Sorry for the double post but idk if you'll see it if I just edited it in  Read this super long post and see if you relate to it?...
INTP would be my guess. Got some hunches that you may be INFP but it's possible for some T's to be a bit feely and vice versa  EDIT: Re-read this and now I'm leaning towards you being an S-type.....
My life in one sentence

double post
'Why not both? It's more fun to be open to diffrent possibilities! ;)
I imagine INFPs as dreamy space prince, dyed hair (natural color or not) and oversized sweater. Idk if i'm wrong but if anyone want to argue my stereotypes please go ahead :'')
They're cute!  A bit awkward, but sensible and gentle.. Their femininity is actually pretty attractive, you just want to hug them and never let go <3
hey guys ;)
I often get asked to BE quiet but yeah............
I really like boy names that start with A, so probably Adam or Alan. In girls, I really like names that are already an existing word like Justice or Hope, I guess it's a cultural thing :p

Hahaha that's cool. At my college, people are mostly into mainstream hip-hop/rap, so I sort of stand out when I have no idea what's going on in that music world. I do love the beats, I just cant get...
Sociology major, Political Science minor, with an interest in Urban Sociology, Crime, and Deviance. Yay for Social Sciences.:laughing:

An INFP did wonders for my life...when things were good, they were AMAZING. But when he would really try to make me reason I simply could not see it from his perspective. He frustrates me when he...
Hey! Welcome to the site! I hope you find everything that you're loking for. I've found this site to be very helpful and hope you will also. :)
Hey fellow ENFPs...I was wondering about peoples' favorite types of music. I really am looking for some new music and was just curious to see if there were any trends. Personally, I'm a fan of post...
Welcome. Hope this site serves you well. :) Posted via Mobile Device
Welcome fellow ENFP! And omg, I'm so excited to see someone else who loves soundtracks. Excellent taste. :)  Also, I've noticed several ENFPs mention Anthropology as a major. I'll be taking...
Wow. This has really helped me see I'm not alone. I feel so indecisive about careers it isn't even funny. I'm a sociology major but I have no idea what I'm going to do after school. I know what I...
I definitely don't understand ISTJs. How can someone just be so...stable? I guess we ENFPs are traditionally known for that. With all the ISTJs I know, I feel like I can never win arguments because...
I really like that idea of getting involved together. We don't have anything like that but I'm sure we could find a common interest (probably something politically oriented) and join forces on it....
As an ENFP, I have a hard time accepting the idea that someone will be never change. I have a tendency to strain healthy relationship to try to save people who are hurting themselves. For example,...
I agree with that. We do have relative ease completing any tasks because one of us always has the skill set for it.  My issue is with the second part. I've talked to him about looking for things we...

I've been mistaken for an ENFP before because of my ADHD. I exhibit Ne traits, but I'm still very much an ENFJ with more Ni than Ne.  The creativity of Ne and the creative energy that often comes...
I've only been drunk once, and that was at a close friend's bachelor party (they all wanted me to get drunk btw, so I wasn't some random guy getting drunk while everyone else was sober). We were all...
Yes. All of the above. I also love Prismacolor markers (they are magical)!
Forgive me for saying this, but I don't think any of those options are really factors tied to extroversionx97I think that introverts can feel/not feel those same things.   Sociability and...
It doesn't feel good, but sometimes, people (no matter how much we may love them) aren't a good fit for a job, and they have to be let go.   It may help if you think of it as helping them to find...

Yeah, had to reupload mine, and now I can see mine, though many others are still missing.
Mine disappeared, but since I reuploaded it, it has been fine. But it would seem that an internet error raccoon stole everyone's avatar.

I'd probably say something like Haha, well it has to be done! or something to that affect. If that response isn't good enough, I blame the first person for not making their intentions clear enough.
Yes.
Hahaha oh well, I tried. :blushed:  I mean, who doesn't love a bit of an ego boost? Tough crowd. :laughing:
Oh ENTJ's, what wonderful wit you have!  (does that count?)  :tongue:
If you mean that certain people have a more visible impact, then sure. Some people are given less influence than others, but that doesn't make them any less important. It's hard for us to see that...
It's easy to fall into, but best avoided. In the end, it won't help anything. Seeing self-pity in others makes me pity them, because I feel like they've fallen into a trap that limits their...
I'm almost positive that you're an ISFJ. The ISFJ vibe is strong with you. :jedi-lightsaber:
Yes, all human life is valuable. To start saying that only certain lives matter is subjective. Also, we're just humansx97who are we to say what lives do and don't matter? To try to say some do and some...
I think it depends on the kind of ambition you're referring to.   If it's changing the world/dealing with social injustices, I'd say ENFP.  If it's inventing new things or trying to achieve...
I like it, but only if I have time for it. Anymore, it seems like I'm too busy to spend hours playing chess. I really enjoyed it when I was younger and didn't have nearly as much stuff to do...
True, real love doesn't work that way. You might feel an instant attraction, but it won't usually be a love at first sight kind of thing. Initial attraction can be there, sure, but feeling instantly...
Well, I grew up with an ESFJ mother, so my sensory perception (and my feelings) were encouraged. I definitely think I have stronger tertiary Se than the average ENFJ, and being a graphic...
Yes, definitely. I have ADHD, and while the impulsiveness and energy I have often leads people to think I'm an ENFP, there's no denying my Judging preference. I like structure, organization, and I'm...

Thats a wonderful analisis. Even thought my own way of see the things is different, I find this view very logic and interesting.

My ENFP twin sister has prepared me for this moment.  *ahem*  I despise kittens, handicapped people, justice, mercy, and honesty! Liars are awesome! Hypocrites excite me!  How'd I do? *grins*
Oh man, I know exactly how this feels. :( I'm truly truly sorry.   When you have to make THAT decision, sometimes people don't understand just how far they've pushed you. When I cut someone off, it...
You know what? Tell him to knock it off. Tell him you don't think it's funny, that you've respected his right to not like or own a cat, but you do like them and what he's saying makes you feel weird....
Oh wow, where to start.  1. Passive-aggression and guilt trips - those will flip my kill switch faster than just about anything. Whatever you'd hoped to get from me is now utterly lost, and I...
Because I'm Watson-y, so very very Watson-y. :-
She's got me beat in the style and poise departments. : And the boobies. Alllllways with the boobies.
JD seems like an extroverting INFJ. I would absolutely take him for an fe-intensive NFJ.
Not meant to be. There *was* a girl. The fact that both your tone *and* your approach have not varied in a span of many many months, well, that's of interest.    There was no potential in your...
Thank you for humoring me. :)   I find I have a good dynamic with my INTJ best friend, but I think ultimately, we're too similar. To that, I mean to say, we both have a boatload of Ni and our Js...
We've crossed paths before, Adasta. Did you ever forgive her, the ENFJ that broke your heart? Whatever you've chosen, the bitterness of the old wound is still there in your words.
I have an ESFJ friend, and when we talk to each other, it's like having some crazy Vulcan mind-meld. O.o BUT, I would say in a romantic sense, that would be a LOT of Fe-primary flying around. I mean,...
How so? Perhaps the ones of your acquaintance?   Romantically, both of those types with an ENFJ would be disastrous. :
If he's anything like Gael Garcia Bernal, I will tear his pants off right now. That's an INFP I can get with.'
'There are some really awesome ENFJ facebook group pages! It is so awesome! I have already talked to a ton of people on the pages, I have been on a high about this for days.  On facebook are: ...

Greetings.  You have come to the right place. This is the land of ENFJ's :)  Are you good at the guitar? I believe Jimmy Hendrix was ISFP.
I am going to look that up, that is fascinating. Great article.   I would say that in general I have been very satisfied with my relationships with everyone EXCEPT intimate relationships. I simply...
Do you have any friends that are ENFJ's?
I am sure a lot depends on their Ennegram type and instinct type, along with lifestyle. One of my friends is ENFJ type 4 (striving to be unique) and it is always really fun talking to her.   I talk...
I have not been in a relationship with another ENFJ, I am curious to know how it would work out too.
I prefer talking to people when I can,   but if that is not an option, I listen to music, do light repetitive exercise, or create strategies to eliminate or avoid the stress.   I should start...
From the friendzone, how hard is it to get out?
You have officially died and gone to ENFJ heaven!  I feel that INFJ's and ENFJ's can learn a lot from each other.
I guess that since the character is fictional, he can be given any qualities. Homer may have started to give him qualities of an ENFJ, but then gave him some ESTP qualities when it fit better into...
The probably with typing characters is that they are created by the authors. They may pick and choose attributes that are consistent with certain types.  What about Odysseus?
What about Atticus from To Kill a Mockingbird?
I like my clothes a like more comfy...If you know what I mean. Here is my teddy.....   272794
[QUOTE=radu;14967106]That's because we can get you to do whatever w.. Hey! Did I mention you look really nice today ? :)  Are you a model? I have never met a model before!   Muhahahaha
“A Dog Has Died” by Pablo Neruda  all his sweet and shaggy life, always near me, never troubling me, and asking nothing.
I would consider it excellent manipulation/strategy because there is the overt and subtle part.   Did you catch the subtle part?
It is a constant battle!  And you have to BE many different people and play many different roles. This is something that is very hard for other types to understand.   What if someone desperately...
I will admit, there are some things that are sneaky that I throw in once in a while. Sometimes when I am arguing with someone else, I throw in comments or questions that I know will throw them off....
The idea of causal sex always sounds nice, but there has to be some sort of meaningful connection or I just feel guilty.   I love having sex, but I definitely do not think it is life-changing. I...
I do not know about ENFJ....I would say that he is a Type 7 Enneagram though, which explains the charisma.   Other than the charisma, he does not seem to use Fe as a dominant. He is just a little...
I am not sure what to think when people say that ENFJ's are manipulative....  In what ways can you be manipulative?   I will admit that I have used social pressure to crush conflict. By that,...
Hahaha, I laugh because...  It is true! I feel the same way.
Now I take criticism as an advantage. Regardless of whether it is meant as advice or just to tear me down, it is an opportunity to test for insecurities.   For example, if someone said You are...
Hahaha, I never thought of 'givers' as sluts!   I like the suggestions: Catalyst And ones using idealistic and guidance in the name
ENFJ's,  What do you consider to be the toughest part of being an ENFJ?  For me, it is sensitivity to criticism. It hurts much more when I am not prepared for it.
The Standard ENFJ treatment is precisely how I would put it if that ENFJ was ME.   I always text people back regardless of who they are, just because:  - I think it is rude to not respond. - I...
I recommend doing something hands-on that you love, especially a sport.  I started kicking boxing and Krav Maga (Israeli martial art) and it really helped my Se. I always write in a journal and...
I would say that I take a leadership position in about everything. That is just because no one else wants to truly lead.   I think that we give as a way to establish harmony, which in a way is...
It can apply to other types.....but then it might also not be included in their strategy.  Sometimes people become so routine and limited in their strategy that they do not have much of a range of...
I am testing out the idea of the Enneagram types for dating. If a girl does not fulfill my need for excitement at all, I just feel depressed and want to run away.   Maybe couples are more like to...
That is dead on.   The amount of neediness and petty quarrels in dating do feel like a devolution of my life. The worst is when girls go through a strong testing phase as they let all of their...
Accuracy relates to the objective.   Perspective relates to the subjective.  For example:  Searching to explain the meaning of life might be important.   But it is not important, because it...
Type 6: Striving to be Secure  Richard Pryor     Type 7: Striving to be Excited
Here are some examples that I have found of different ENFJ Enneagram types through celebrity videos.   Type 1: Striving to be Perfect  Brene Brown  
I am going to explain each system first as explaining them all together is something that continuously confuses people.   Instead of the 7w8, 1w2, and 3w2.....  Think of it as 713 for now.  ...
Instead of dominant, let us call it a lead cognitive function. For instance, for INTP it would be ACCURACY (supported by EXPLORATION).  PERSPECTIVES - Finding the metaperspective or the superior...
Yes. But casual in a way that I do spend time with them and do like being around them. And we do go on casual dates.   I just assume that it may never go anywhere.   I do think of long-term...
I am trying to see how Enneagram types can help out with compatibility for dating.   I am ENFJ type 7 and I often find dating to be very unfulfilling because it is so BORING. I just want some...
You explained that beautifully, thank you!  I find it frustrating trying to explain/teach this material to others. It is so crystal-clear to me but other people seem to have all these different and...
Great recommendation. I am trying to figure out a way to frame that so people realize that their types are permanent.
You have to go for it.
It is completely missing the point.   If you were creating a human race, would you make them all the same type of person? Would that make any sense?   Psychological types exist to balance out...
I understand how the shape-shifting tendencies weird people out. As a ENFJ type 7, I play all sorts of parts and it baffles people.
I am VERY particular. And I have not dated certain girls because I did not want to lose them as friends.   I have never had a casual friendship turn into a significant relationship.  I have a ton...
Could you not tell the guy was INTP?  Is that not logically consistent?  Is it not logically consistent that psychological types exist?
I cannot speak for all ENFJ's, but I am hard-wired to read emotional reactions and states. The INFP's that I have met are REAL, they act true to who they feel as a person. It is amazingly easy to...
Of course you do not see the point of the video. You probably did not even watch it.    That IS the point.
The types fit because the way they use their cognitive functions fit perfectly with the functions. They act in ways that fit almost all of the clusters of data written about them, even though those...'
