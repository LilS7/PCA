Maybe we could come up with some technology to alter other types into INTJ's? Too inhumane? I guess cloning works too... :/

Hey, I'm a girl, not a HE. ;P And yeah, I suppose what you say is true.
Can you give me an example so I can better understand what you mean? I don't want to misconstrue your question.
But you have to think, how often do I get excited over my conversations with people? Small talk or gossip doesn't excite me, so my voice wouldn't get louder over that, would it?   I just feel that...
It's possible. When I get excited I sometimes have people telling me to quiet down.
That does sound dirty. :P And I don't think I just tweaked. I full out changed myself. I look back at how I used to act towards other people and it frightens me how twisted I was. I was kind of...

I would say the closest thing I can compare it to a need to make sure things are working in my immediate environment because if this is not the case it otherwise it causes disharmony/tension and I...
This mean you believe you are on the thinker side of the camp but cant for the life of you determine which one? If so then I would very much agree I have exactly the same issue.  I am inclined to...
Wish I knew frankly --- but officially (company paid assessment) I have consistently tested as an ESTP/ISTP (even ENTP at times) though I don't relate much at all to the ESTP stereotypes (agin they...
I would say Yes -- only because this reminds me a great deal of myself.
This is what I get for responding to these late at night, end up missing entire words! You are correct their well-being at risk.    I am inclined to agree, whatever  the function it is very...
Hello All,  I have gone back and forth for years between ESTP, ISTP, ENTP, INFJ and INTJ and tested formally as an ESTP/ENTP/ISTP multiple times but frankly, I have no clue anymore. Do any of you...

Mystery solved..beyond the shadow of a doubt I am the contributor category. For those INTJ's out there do you see yourself as putting on a mask as a means to an end? I certainly do though I have...
Frankly I think I am going to step far far away from the functions --- they seem a bit too vague to understand in practice. Given the function dichotomy only I feel pretty good. I would say I am...

Ok....I think I officially give up. On whim I took the keys to cognition assessment again in bold, being careful to go with my gut responses.. yeah nothing like the results a page back (not bolded)....

Myst91  Thanks again forgot to mention clarifying the lack of Fi is a big win for me. I feel like at this point I need to dig into the inferior function to get a handle on which of the above types...
Frankly I would boil the whole experience down to being extremely draining for you. I don't know I would go so far as being shredded though that depends on the country some of the basic training is...
Thank You Myst91!  This was extremely helpful! Lets see if I can address some your questions directly and add a bit of clarity.  In great detail, like? Show me what kind of detail you mean....

Interesting link.   Thank you for the advice re Naranjo books. I'll follow that up.
It seems to me that, although he probably hasn't achieved the level of Jung or Freud in the public mind, Naranjo is the greatest living theorist on personality theory. I wondered what experiences -...

Actually, reading through the actual tritype descriptions, my natural opposite seems to be the 2-6-9, not the 2-7-9. The good samaritan rather than the peacemaker!!

So steel is significantly cheaper in china and what is suppose to be a piece of elegant art is made cheaply as well?
I could change, but it feel like I have wasted 6 months of my life plus I still don't know what I want to do. Perhaps you might have some advice for an uncertain person like me?
Perhaps I should have used another word instead of replica or mention if it were a real functional item in reality. Then again not much people know that there are many replicated items from fiction...
don't you ever feel like you don't know what to do with your life and bit by bit you start to regret making such big plans and they're not quite what you hoped. FUCK WHY DID I HAVE TO PICK A CAREER...
I find that being depressed helps, it hurts but in the end you just don't care and your body goes into auto-pilot. so just zone out and only chime in when ever some important comes up.  *WARNING...

I believe Dan E already answered the question.  Ok, next question. What seems small but bigger on the inside?
I am going to with option D, leave it alone. I have a similar friend that does this and he goes to a very very good school may even be the best in the world. When vocation come he really want to...
Ah yes, I always wanted to listen to crickets...    I think it would be an interesting phenomena, I imagine it would be like looking at the multiverse and behind each one is a group of  INTJs is...
i see what you did there. borderline intj/p.
