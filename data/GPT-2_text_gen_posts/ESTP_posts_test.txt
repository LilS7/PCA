'Orange Beach wants to pay to bring drug testing back to Gulf Shores High | al.com @Arclight @stone100674 @walking tourist @KittyKraz13  Thank you all very much. When/if this plan is put into motion...
Hello again PerC, long time no see.  At my high school they have recently unveiled a new plot to conduct a schoolwide, biweekly to drug test every student who attends the school. AFAIK, I thought...
Ever since I started to become a little addicted to l4d I've started to wonder about the personality types of the cast of both of the games. So, here goes:  Francis: ISTP  Bill: ENTJ  Louis:...
Oh god, I remember every single one of my dreams. They are pretty down to earth most of time, but I think they have hidden meanings. They are weird as hell to, just ask IndyAnnaJoan, she's...
EDIT: shit, accidental double post
Well, I like to see life as a game. It's all about success and humiliation, embarrassment, losing fights, gossip, drama, and events.  It's an Se thing.
Yeaaaa.   I can also see how people fear us. We are a very powerful personality type, and we tend to stick out like a sore thumb in crowds. And yes, even though I am an ESTP, I often do envy other...
But I didn't... :cool:
So in my physical science class in school, we have this weird teacher (most likely an INTP :P), and during labs, her class is torture, she sucks at giving instructions, and she gets flustered when...
MBTI tests are a good starting point, but it's up to you to decide from there.
Moral of the story: there are some creepy ass mofos on the internet.
I'm trying to see if I can find any correlation between the 8 letters and stubbornness.
- He is a male  - Extremely impulsive, self declared kleptomaniac (which I believe is true)  - Loves to be high/drunk, but doesn't mind being sober  - gets in trouble often, last week he was...
I think Jake is an INTP only because he is lazy.
I think the ability to lie very well comes from either Se or Ti, I could be wrong.
I know several peoples who's families are all in the SP temperament. So this lead me to asking the question: Do SP's run in families?  Does anyone here have SP families?
The indecisiveness comes from the N, not the J/P, a common misconception.  I can't decide for myself if you are a J or P, but everyone else so far thinks you're a J. I'm sure of the INFx though.
I can relate with 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 (but I smoke too), and somewhat 11. I'm thinking he's either ESFP or ESTP, but I'm pretty sure it's ESFP.
I speak very loudly. It's hard for me to be quiet. Not to mention my voice is very deep, one of the deepest in my choir class. I wish I had a little more range though.
My computer is fucked over from malware. Here's some of the symptoms  - Computer randomly shutting down - Volume will randomly change itself (especially annoying when I'm playing a game) -...
Yep, I've been in INFJ mode before. It's not fun. I'm quiet as hell, very aggressive, paranoid, always assuming the worst about every situation, thinking everyone is out to get me.  This happened...
Mom - ENTJ Dad - ISFP Me - ESTP Sister - INTP Brother - ESxP (too young to determine T/F)  I think this guys on the right track.
Here's a screenshot of all the dumbfucks... 
My friend shared this image on facebook, thinking that this (fake) photo is religious or something. All her dumbass friends think it is too.  Little do they know, it's actually goatse in the sky!...
There's the N... :D
Yep, even you thought you were an ESTP :P  Shame you had to leave us.
I'm almost 100% percent sure Stan is an introvert. You know how much time he spends alone? There is several episodes that express this characteristic of his. There is even one where he realizes he...
Simply from your style of writing, I can surely guess that your ExxP. And that fact that you forget things and lose things is N thing, not a P thing. But with all the descriptions you gave us, I'm...
I think it has to do with the Enneagram type really, like Adrenaline said. Even a 7w8 can be manipulative.  However I do disagree with whoever said ESTP's don't prey on the weak and gullible. ...
I'm thinkin ESTP. I'm the exact same way in school. I have a few ISTP friends and I noticed they hardly like to draw attention to themselves, they barely even talk, lol.  It's relatively easy to...
And of course Paragon is offended again. Noone else seems to be complaining.  I thought you blocked me anyways.  I would like to know how this is sexist, too.
So in credit recovery (computer class you take if you fail a class so  you can retake it) this ugly ass looking girl took my computer instead  of taking hers, when I noticed mine was missing I...
Yea, I'm very paranoid sometimes, however I am always anxious. Like Fizz said it probably has to do with Ni.
meh, I don't mind wasting time. One of my weaknesses tbh.
- Should it be legalized?  Hell to the yes.  - What do you like or dislike about it?  I just love the feeling and the act of smoking.  - Funny stories associated with smoking it?
I'm only socially anxious in certain situations.  Especially when my paranoia kicks in. I can be very paranoid sometimes.
I've been inactive for awhile, and now I am attempting to make a return. :cool:  I'll try to post as much as I can now.
Liminality  If she has no problem with/with others knowing the first three, I would say ISTJ, if her jokes are more 'loud'/direct/blunt/possibly a little cruel/harsh in their directness. How does...
That's a pretty useless degree unless you wanna become a teacher.
Not really a fanboy of Halo, but people have always given me shit for liking Halo more than Call of Duty. I do love Halo though. I just think Call of Duty is incredibly overrated and there's really...
It isn't to me. I enjoy deep and abstract thoughts.
I wanna get in on this shit but I don't think I'm cool enough:crying:
I think it may have something to do with me being left handed (right brained). Since right brainers think subjectively and intuitively.  I've always been somewhat intuitive. But I am also a very...
Is there any exceptions to this? My Fe is very developed and I am gonna be sixteen soon. My top 4 functions that I used (in order) were Se, Si, Fe, Ti. Se and Si were very close, so was Fe and Ti.
As for the Fe thing...  A well developed and mature ESTP is much more considerate of other peoples feelings. They dislike inconvenience for other people. ESTP's with well developed Fe also defend...
ESTP + ISFJ = relation of Supervision, where the ISFJ was the supervisor, and the ESTP (me) was the supervisee.  I honestly don't get socionics at all.
I've fixed my other computer (the one that just stopped working), I found out you can reformat the disc during startup.  And the other computer, well, got all the drivers, and it crashes waaaaaay...
Only one I can really think about is Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes.
Is ESTP + ISFJ generally a good match when it comes to relationships?  Has any ESTP dated an ISFJ before? could you tell me how it went?
Lol, is that a joke? Can't tell :tongue:'

We're out of booze... and stereotypical descriptions of ourselves, so we come here hoping people like you will provide us with some more.
We're not as vague VS certain ENFJs.

No, I'm accusing them of being random and going off on tangents not related to the subject at hand. I wouldn't say INTPs are illogical, I'd say their way of constructing sentences are.

Ne doms and Se doms typically display this trait.
mhhhhhhhhh...... Some kind of ENFP or ESFP. Hard to decide. You seem extraverted and also seem to have Fi secondary. That means Ne dom or Se dom. It is quite easy to confuse between the two of them,...

I told a member  of my family  to read the description of Estp and they found it mostly true except that long conversation and deep doesnt bother me
Ok thank you
Yes i think it but i think i'm not the stereotype maybe
does ADD have a impact on type ?
ahh ok thank you    i should have think of that
it may not be the most selfish but they are more evident    i had a crush on a girl and when she was depressed i used to talk to her and empathize/sympathize with her but i was in need   she was...
Maybe it has been said but any way   the types that may seem more selfish are    the  Fi to me  it may be just an opinion but   more introverted Fi like ISFP or INFP
no if you know for sure that i use SE ............NI  type and not Ne .............Si    then it is Estp   because i'm pretty sure  that i use Ti Fe  It was only the first and the fourth that...

well thank you for you time Pifanjr   (:
Can you explain why ?     How do you see it
seriously hahha well thank you

Yes of xxTP would be more accurate i think
SiFan

I also say even if i adapt well i seem more introvert than pure extravert like even if i like to be center of attention and say speech and more extravert than introverts

ENFJs use Fe, focus on your Fi instead. ENTJs use Fi and Fe is usually one of their weakest functions.
edit: wrong thread -_-
i'd rather be an ESTJ so i could more done.
function wise you two are opposite according to Beebe's functions.   palobell the shell cracks don't you worry about it ;).
lol i do this kind of shit all the time to mess with people's heads.   here's one you can try, walk into a gift store and ask where's my gift?
ESTPs want to test laws and break laws.  ENTPs want to test people and break the norms of society.

had a snow day with cliodna :D no work, hot chocolate, jammies, duvets, the heat's on full blast ʘ‿ʘ  it's -8 degrees over here.
so the problem is you don't use Ti but Se however you're not an extrovert?  maybe you use Fi? you need a T/F function so what would you say it is?

Hey, yeah. That's an interresting topic.  I can't remember, how often i've discussed this with others. But it was really often... I have three circles of friends.  The first one consists mainly...
Try the kamasutra. :crazy:
I'm the younge one of the two boys my parents have. My bro is four years older and an INTJ.
I'm an ESTP.  On long journeys (on the German Autobahn, of cause) it might be something like this:  shhhhhhhh/roaaaar! (the sound of my blood in ears/the sound of me speeding up) .... ... damn...
Yeah, welcome!:happy:  I think, mirroring others is our ES way to show we like someone.  So, you're a freak, too? Don't bother 'bout it! All others are just too boring while we freaks are having...
I think I'm really good in empathy. When talking to people I feel their emotions and intentions by reading their face, voice, gesture and whole body language. In my job this makes it easy to push...
We are absolutely likeable - that's proved! As long as I can remember there have always been lots of people around me, seeking my company and wanting to be friends. This is a really convenient...
I'm basically a righty. But I tend to hold my beer with the left hand so i can use my right to grab some snacks. :wink:

Only 4 - 5 % of the US population are ESTPs [Estimated Frequencies of Types - CAPT.org]. No wonder why we are precious few.
staying friends is not the worst case. be glad to have this guy around taking care of your welfare. making him your foe might be a really bad experience.
The description of this guy sounds familiar. :wink:  Maybe a ExTP with an almost balanced S/N.
Yes, perhaps. I would act like this.
...relax and enjoy.
OMG, we ESTPs are the most trustworthy persons you can imagine! I think, most of the guys blaming us ESTPs are just jealous. :proud:  I agree, we sometimes tend to banter with someone. But hey, we...
better check for your moneybag afterwards. :laughing:
You know, we ESTPs might appear jejune when it comes to our own feelings. But we're having emotions, too, although some of us are not showing them at all. Being good friend with an ESTP is easy, but...
Just talk to him and ask directly. Tell him about the rumors you heared and that you feel uncomfortable with the things you were told. Seek a candid conversation - don't try to ask awkward questions...'
