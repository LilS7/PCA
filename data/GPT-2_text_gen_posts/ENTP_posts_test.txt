Dad: ESTJ Mom: ENFJ (or ESFJ)  You guys think that two J's make a P? Because my little brother's an ISFP.
I listen to music for music's sake. I don't have to associate to a past memory.  I really haven't given much thought into what makes music good or bad in my mind, but I guess it has to sound like...
I don't even actually sound like that!  Ehhh, whatever makes the post entertaining I guess. Waddya gonna do?
I'm not sure why I think this is hilarious, but I do.  Don't judge me.
I don't lavish people with compliments that they don't deserve, but that doesn't mean I never say anything positive about people.  It's just that when I see these groups of people fluttering around...
Pissing people off seems to come naturally for me, whether or not I mean to do it.  Ironically, people seem to get more pissed off at me whenever I'm in a serious and non-comedically-condescending...
I love acting.  As for trying to pursue it, sorta. I'm in a training job for a radio station in my country, I write and act my own sketches.
The first half was pretty great, but then it turned into some TV-movie level cheesiness.  But yeah, the Darth Maul scene in the OP got me good.
You know when you just won't be convinced by a pseudoscience that your friend is trying to get you into, because you don't see enough evidence to support it? You know when he calls you out on being...
One time I got ENFP, but that's because when the test asked Do you hang out a lot with people, I didn't realize that it meant that I liked being with people, so I answered Yes.
Oh, well, the comfort-zone thing definitely. Sometimes it's unintentional, but usually it's intentional. Usually it's because I want to get the to be as curious about things as I am, and sometimes it...
Here's the thing.  We ENTPs? Smart as shit. Alright? Our sense of humor? Smart as shit? We only laugh at things intellectually stimulating. Sorry, other types, but this here? Pinnacle of...
I think when you break down a big issue to find a joke in it, it's the first step to getting over it.
Of course it's harmless.  I was just commenting on the imaginations of the people back then. And when you notice the pattern, it explains a lot about people today.
Wow.  People really are imaginative.
I like talking to people and I don't mind going to parties. I especially like debating with a whole group of people.  That doesn't mean that I go out of my way to make these things happen. In fact...
Man, I hate Dane Cook. Especially that one joke he did about atheists.    But all his fans love this joke. Do they actually think that atheists get mad...
No? I don't share the pictures, people share with me.
You know what's even worse?  The one idiot who actually forgets to write his damn name.
I am sick and tired of seeing shit like this on my wall all the damn time.   There are several reasons why...
You're an ENTP. Something bullshit that society has been collectively doing has been bugging you for a while, and you will let it out here.  Aaaaand...Go. (This should be fun).
A friend showed me one episode once. I didn't really like it.    This sort of illustrates why. It just...the referential humor didn't really feel that...
Yeah, it's pretty mandatory. I just saved your life.
Well, ENTP's have been called the same. So do some ENTJ's.  But I take it back. She's either an INTJ, or an ENTJ. But her Te seems to be more dominant than her Ni, and she obviously has repressed...
Actually, she's either an ENTJ or ENTP. I don't think that bit at the end where she starts rapidly insulting you is very INTP-ish. Especially the bit where she goes like You're not a doctor. You're...

Hey, uh, Resta um?  Could you not have just said Chill man, I was just kidding.? I think that would've summed up your entire argument pretty quickly.
Of course.  Sorry, but isn't that all too easy? I mean, think about it, how do you know your guy isn't the wrong source? I mean if you divide one type, into a bunch of other sub-types, then of...
I don't believe in astrology. I just don't see how stars and planets can determine personality, they're not psychologically linked in any way. The inventors of astrologers used it to predict the fate...

Figured. I get that sometimes, but I try to hear other people out. Criticism helps, after all.  Back on ENFP, even if I ever considered the guy annoying, I think that feeling was beaten by my...
Hahaha how's an unhealthy ENTP like? What, too arrogant or self-assured?
Don't you just hate grammar Nazis?

I dunno, man. After almost 2 years of being with an INFJ, I am currently more lost and confused than ever.
I'm a hedonist in that I intentionally seek out long-term pleasure. Or at least ideally. Like through eating healthy and exercising. Yeah!   Except I've been eating tons of ice cream and chocolate...
I'm pretty sure my mom is an ENTJ or ENFJ (Seriously can't tell if she uses Fe or Te, but I know for a fact that she has the Ni since she somehow knows EVERYTHING ABOUT ME without me telling her.)...
I failed the driving test 4 times (got disqualified 3 of those times, twice within the first 5 minutes) before finally getting my license on the 5th try, and it only took a year and 3 days. I'm...
Dear INFJ,  You are a crazy motherfucker, but I love you anyway. Now that I am finally be in charge of my own transportation methods, I can say with 100% certainty that you are more than just a...
I think that what helped me figure out that I have no Fi whatsoever is the fact that when someone I know is feeling upset or any other negative emotion, I can generally figure out how they are...
As an ENTP, the only word I recognized in all those sentences was breast.
I've found that pretty much all INTPs that I've been friends with have been very sincere, even if in a seemingly mean or overly blunt way sometimes. I'm guessing that may have to do with the fact...
5'8 and 120 pounds. Living up to the ENTP stereotype, yet again.
D'awww so cute. Does she usually comply with that request and let you have a cat-tastic phone chat?  I would hope that loving cats would be an ENTP thing since cats are awesome. My cat is a total...
Because I love kitties and petting cats makes me happy. :3 Unless they have rabies or are a tiger or something. I can't pet tigers with rabies, too dangerous.
1. Fun. 2. Acquiring knowledge. 3. Petting cats. 4. Maintaining awesome relationships with awesome people. 5. Not sucking at life/school/things.  That's pretty out of order though. I think...
One time I was mad and drunk so I tried beating up my ENTP friend. He wouldn't fight back though so I just went upstairs to calm myself down. I bet he wasn't fighting back because I'm pretty...

ITP. Hmm, I don't think I was ever really an introvert, I was just really cynical and hated associating with about 99.5% of the people at my school, but they were lame anyway. I had about 7ish...
Oh gosh, psychedelics are so interesting. I don't feel like that doing drugs has really changed me all that much as a person, other than now I'm just myself and in addition to that, I occasionally...
Overall, I have slightly more male friends than female friends, but the friends that are closest to me are female. None of my female friends are the crazy overly-emotional types though, which is...
But I thought I was sexy! WHAT IS THIS MADNESS :shocked:  All the Js and Ps I associate with are pretty sexy though, but I could just be biased. Or I just have objectively sexy friends. Too much...
Wow what a weirdo. If you were ENTP you'd be way less weird, but you're INTP and therefore weird.   Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Am I just projecting? OH NO! I'M THE WEIRDO!?!?!?
I find reading about old school freak show acts and serial killers to be pretty amusing. Especially the serial killers. Looking for patterns in how various ones work and the differences between them...
A few years ago I was crazily obsessed with this one guy and thought he was absolutely perfect, dated him for 7 months, and then went crazy on him because I was too stressed out to be able to...
Yeah, that happens sometimes when I'm not really paying attention to what I'm saying so I just say whatever is currently in my brain despite the potential consequences.  One time I was chilling...
I have the cutest cat ever. That's brag-worthy, right? Meow. :3
1. Does intellect attract you? So much. 2. Do you care if your mate is smart? Have you ever dated down? I dated a high school dropout once. He wasn't really that stupid, just really bad at life....
I'm a giant hypochondriac without the follow-through. I think I have some weird physical problems, like the fact that I throw up after not eating for too long, but I never bothered to go further than...
Most of my phone calls start with Hey, I'm outside your house, so that's pretty convenient and efficient for me. I much prefer texting for conversational purposes. I think calling should usually be...
I think the best way to keep all the dishes clean is to allow him to only use one specific plate, one specific mug, one specific fork, etc. I know I have a problem with leaving all my dirty dishes in...
I'm pretty fond of my INFJ, so I'd have to agree that EVERYTHING THEY SAY ABOUT INFJ + ENTP IS TRUE.   I can imagine an ENTP being happy with a person of any type as long as they kept them...
INFJs are pretty neat, but I could be biased.
My dad and I are both NTPs and we're super sensitive to all temperatures. I think that must mean that ALL NTPs must be super sensitive to temperature, right? Oh wait except I know some NTPs that are...
I heard your terrible Fe doesn't allow you to feel very many things, let alone recognize the things you do occasionally feel. Life as a robot must be pretty boring. Too bad you can't cuddle math or...
I know a few ENTPs that are terrible people that feel no remorse, so I think all ENTPs are likely to not feel any remorse. That's how it works, right? Aww yeah, faulty inductive reasoning.   Really...
I've heard that some ENTPs don't like cats, and I LOVE cats. I love cats so much. I have stuffed cat toys all over my room and I metaphorically pee myself with joy every time a cat shows up. Other...
It all depends on who I'm talking to and the situation and all that stuff.  With teachers or authority figures that I respect (they totally exist, strangely enough), I stare them down so it looks...
I don't discriminate, I hate all temperaments equally.     Just kidding, you're all beautiful. :3 Except NTs. Those guys are crazy overly-logical robotic jerks.
Jake from Adventure Time. He seems pretty ENTP to me.
I wanna be best friends with Mal Reynolds from Firefly, if that counts.
That sounds more like Scooby Doo than Firefly now! Haha. Hmm, I wonder if my friends and I could do that without all of us going crazy and killing each other. I think it could work, except it...
My family immigrated to American from Russia when I was 7. My dad is INTP and my mom is ENTJ, and they had very few problems adapting compared to other Russians that came here at about the same time....
I'd think that Ne-dominants would be really good at public speaking since they'd be able to use Ne to seamlessly connect one idea to the next. Also, they tend to be pretty enthusiastic about most...
My only INFP friend makes me feel awesome. She's one of the few people I can hang out with when I'm sad and not want to jump off a bridge from blocked off bad feelings because she's so understanding...

Rala oohhh.  damn I have to weigh things out now. Will it be hard to learn these two languages at the same time? Are their roots too far from each other to show any resemblance?
oh. for a second, I thought you're a native speaker. I'll try searching stuff up but I'm gonna start from scratch. Might as well expect to be bombarded with loads of questions. Thanks in advance!
draculaoverlord you won't mind acting as my tutor then? haha

I don't socialise that much... I lie. (I do but I don't feel like I do)  It is the evidence (ie. photographs) during the aftermath and my personality that creates the illusion that I go out and...'
'This test wasn't even close on my gender, age, or MBTI type.
Interesting. I checked out the GoTo Quiz. It looks like maybe it takes all the sorting questions from Pottermore? Anyway, with this expanded quiz, I got Ravenclaw at 84% and Slytherin at 73%. I'm...
A lot of ENTPs test Slytherin. I'm kind of a Slytherclaw. I wanted to be Ravenclaw before I read the Ravenclaw description from Pottermore. After reading that, I was hoping more for Slytherin...
I probably did a lot of drugs in my youth... but I don't remember. ;)  I do know that I don't do drugs now.
I like dogs and wish them well and never want to see them abused etc. But I LOVE cats. I live with two of them.
You know you're a thinker when...  A good student comes up about 8 points short of an A in the course you teach. You look through the recent work to see if perhaps you were too tough and could...
My favorite is seeing trees in which children are older than their parents. ;)  But to be honest, my own tree is a combination of thorough research and brainstorming, and I wonder how much of this...
I got interested in the German when the autosomal results gave me unexpected levels of Scandinavian and Eastern European. I expected some Scandinavian just by virtue of having British Isles ancestry,...
I guess I have a different take on this. I do a lot of academic work, and I don't plagiarize ideas.  But in researching my family, I do take hints from distant cousins. Maybe it's the Ozark girl in...
DNA is so much fun! I took one autosomal test, and now I can't stop finding out more and more. It's really become a major fascination of mine.  I1 and U5a1b... sounds like you've got Nordic...
In terms of documented records, I can get my direct paternal line back to the 1650s in Virginia. Well, actually, there's a land grant in 1650. Then there's a 100 year gap between the land grant and...
Well, in fairness, she did say 80s Dance Parties. So... no Disco Balls. Torn T-shirts and Jeans and time to Rock the Casbah!  Oh and yeah... that newfangled VCR contraption thing! Make sure it...
Yes, exactly. :) In recent years, the trend has definitely been towards separating these two groups into divergent generations.    SEO! I'm loving it!  Friday night dance parties and pong FTW!
FWIW, I don't like the name either. But the name has been in circulation for over a decade. My friends and I - years ago - came up with BoXers (in between Boomers and Xers) to describe our...
Actually, it is my contention that the Baby Boom is not a generation at all. It is two sub-generations of different generations welded unnaturally together by a single demographic event (i.e., lots...
LOL.   Or my answers...  Did you go to Woodstock?  No, but I did know a girl in college who hit Sid Vicious with a beer bottle.   Or   did you see the Beatles in concert?
I'm all in favor of a GenJones forum. The Baby Boom is a demographic event, not a generational event, and it's just weird always being lumped in with the older Boomers. They invented the Summer of...
I'm willing to entertain that possibility, but can you explain?
Another female ESTP:  Kara Thrace (a.k.a. Starbuck) from the re-envisioned BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  (at least I've always seen her as ESTP).
Violet may indeed be ISTJ or ESTJ.  As for Maggie Smith... Alan Rickman (who worked with her on Harry Potter) has described Maggie Smith as perhaps the wittiest person alive. He could never keep a...
@pneumoceptor - Thanks for confirming the ineffable nature of your holistic perception. As for movies... well, yeah, I can get caught up in an emotional plot too, especially if it's well done. If...
Celebok - Excellent insight into the S/N divide. I felt completely at home watching the N-dom video. I can get overwhelmed, though, with too many concrete, sensory details - unless I can see them in...
Probably not.  I was 19 when I decided that I needed to figure out the meta-answer to life, the universe, and everything. Intense analysis commenced. I think it's more a youth thing, though, than a...
INTP because even though your comment seems pretty random, it has its own internal logic. ;)
I watched 2 of the videos (I'll get to the third later).  I found the holistic/discrete processing part interesting too. What I think happens with me is that I do get non-linear big picture...
I'm not a clinician by any means, but just based on the OP, this person sounds possibly Borderline Personality Disorder to me.  (threatening suicide? - typical BPD maneuver, unless of course he's...
*deleted content* sorry... double post
Yeah, the Ne/Si seems clear to me. Her world is just all over the place. I'd say INFP.
It's a great album from start to finish. But the finish is my favorite track...  A Day in the Life.
Some classics:  Play Misty for Me Misery Vertigo  Sorry.... Didn't see you wanted modern/underground.
No worries. Like I said, I was just replying to a question about methodologies used on the forum. Someone upthread suggested that a lot of people may be typing based only on type descriptions or...
LOL. I was answering a question from upthread about what sorts of measures go in to members' determination of type. I was not justifying my N preference. I have no need to justify it.
My impression from reading the Forum is that most members have taken at least some sort of test and many have taken multiple tests.  I have taken online tests, the official MBTI Step 1 and Step 2,...
Well yeah it's horrific. But the scene I'm really focused on is the one with one of Frey soldiers bragging about it... before Arya offs him. In the book, we just hear about it in KL. Here, we get a...
Glad you got a laugh!    Not the ones written for the show! ;)  But seriously, I thought the Arya scenes in this episode were just brilliant, giving us a 1st person perspective of the RobbWind...
No, it didn't happen that way in the book. Ygritte shot Jon outside the tower when Summer (Bran's wolf) attacked to help Jon escape and Jon rode off. She got Jon in the leg but not in the shoulder....
In fairness, Dany didn't start the cult. The freed slaves started the cult. She accepted it.   Same result, but different point of origin.
I type you ENTP. ;)  Brilliant!
The ending for the finale was exactly what the episode title indicated, but not what the book fans wanted to see...  All of the book fans I've talked to wanted the episode to end with the awakening...
I think they are unlikely to hire either a high-profile movie actor or an American actor to play the 12th Doctor.
John Hurt is a previously-unknown older incarnation of the Doctor (possibly the version that the 9th Doctor regenerates out of). We will find out more about him - and why the 11th Doctor is so...
A serious flaw, I believe, with typing Gatsby as ENTP is that the object of his devotion is Daisy.   ENTPs make love to ideas. Daisy doesn't have any. She is an insipid, boring airhead. No ENTP...
Gatsby as ENTP? He's a romantic. Everything he does - including his shady business dealings - is done to attain a non-existent romantic ideal. Most ENTPs would get distracted by about a billion other...
No Russian-invented sass in Season 1.
Your patience will be rewarded. ;)  We don't really even start to get a glimpse of Littlefinger in all his glory until the second half of Book 3. As I said before, he's playing what I'd call the...
It's an ENTP, with some cameos by other functions before reaching the inferior.
Sounds like what you really want is William Hatnell. ;)  But is that going a bit TOO wibbly wobbly timey wimey?
Stay tuned. Assuming the TV show does not deviate too far from the books, Littlefinger hasn't even gotten started yet.
To be honest, Littlefinger's most significant plots would involve spoiler territory for you. He'll start to ramp up his game in the next season of the show (second half of the third book).  We're...
Here's one for the Lannister fans in the House...    Enjoy your victory while you still can. ;)'
'I think generally people experience post trauma in a very similar way, which is to seek security and try to rebuild themselves. That being said, I know of a couple who were mega extroverted, friendly...
Like many other people on this thread, I find it absolutely astonishing that you couldn't find a job with that kind of qualification in a medical field. I would have to agree with @Mzansi that an...
I think there is an argument that serious trama could cause a personality shift, however I would doubt that it would be a drastic change.   For example, When I was a kid, I was incredibly...
Its incredibly easy to project intelligence to the masses and I think any fool can do it. The main method is to expand your vocabulary and the best way of doing this is to simply read more widely.  ...
I think you need to look at the facts here.. The fact is theres absolutely no evidence that MBTI actually works outside of a clinical laboratory (refer here for...
Yeah that sounds logical? I have seen other threads simply moved and dumped in the article thread? So really not entirely sure.
welcome mate!  Just delve right in and comment on anything! place is friendly as can be and should help you learn a lot more about yourself!
I think this is one of the oldest questions I remember coming across.. The person who solves this, will be definitely in the running for the MB nobel prize equivalent.   For my own two cents, im...
I think ENTPs aren't born they are forged from their experiences, so I think you can definitely become one of us.   What forced me to develop my Ti was really my upbringing, from being in a...
The action is definitely what is important, unless you are talking about philosophical ideas or other things of artistic merit. Even then, surely in order to articulate your thoughts, an action is...
Well if its for science..   1: What's your MBTI Type? ENTP 2: What's your Gender? Male 3: Are you the eldest child, middle child, or youngest child? Eldest 4: How do you learn: Hands-on,...
lol kind of in the ENTP spirit to be opportunistic, so points I reckon!
Just a scenario and interested to see how you peeps would react.  Walking down a street and notice a hat laying on the side walk, the hat is rather old and battered but your eyes are drawn to it...

get quite sick and shut myself away from the world
Im not sure if this is a forum post.. A blog post.. Or a just a general rant type thing, but i took the time to read and thought I would critique some of the points.   Firstly MB is not an...
Just do it mate and dont tell her about it lol..
Good advice here... Only thing I would add is that you need to make sure the idea is feasible and has certain level of market demand and pick partners wisely. Run your basic ideas by a few people...
There has only been one movie that has bought tears to my eyes... That movie, was the classic free willy! Probably worth noting that I was only 4 or 5 at the time..
No need to worry, it is a PerC wide problem and no one can access their profiles!   They will fix it soon enough.
Was interested to see the INTP perspective on the friend zone and found some of the posts a little crazy and a few of them made me laugh out loud, because it appears some people have taken...
10/10 for being absolutely unique... Might pinch that use it at some future date..
Im usually a happy drunk.. I lose all my intelligence and my vocabulary drops to bordering along the line of grunts. I am usually quite happy, however if I am in a bad mood when I start drinking it...
Thanks Starry :)  Amazing going back over some of my old posts, I could have sworn that we started around the same time because I only really remember talking to you, turm and a king in the early...
interesting
When angered, ENTP is like to blast at you and punch you in the face... Where as INTP is like to calmly reach in his/her pocket for a knife and plunge it deep into your face!
Thank you kindly Mrs Cafebot
Lol ahhh mate this doesn't make you gullible.. Some people tell lies to get out of doing stuff, I do it and im sure you do it every now and again as well. As Nekoninja said, you can never really tell...
When I was a kid (from 5 to 16), my best friend who lived across the road from me was a girl who was a year older. She used to always make up these great stories and I used to fall for them every...
Ahhhh ok? Mmmmm so are you saying then that your gullible?
Im happiest when I am starting a new project or getting my hands on a new gadget to play with. The scene is me on my own and a massive amount pleasure as I start playing around or getting my feet...
I learnt an excellent technique from my dad.. When I was kid, dad was talking to his friend (hardcore christian) and he raised the topic of what man can and cannot eat. Basically dad stood there...
Myself and my ESTP friends are quite similar, but they are slightly more extroverted and don't seem to have as many ideas and opinions as myself.
Ahhh right! That sounds like a rather fascinating job and kind of makes a lot of sense why you would routinely get tested.. Can you speak any other languages?  Thanks for the advice, Ill look them...
Lol from what corner of satans ass did you manage to dig this thread up in?  obviously it's snuff films for me! Other than that would say more a tv series like the peep show. Witty, observational...
Really? What do you do? Does the business have Korean partners or is it a market thing?   Its bloody hard to learn, but I like the Hengel because its kind of similar to the alphabet! I was starting...
When you are criticised for consistently needing time to think something through before you make a decision!
lol I have only really just started.. My gf is Korean so I am kind of learning it for her benefit.. But always fun to learn it with other people :). So you used to be fluent? Where did you originally...
So basically as an ENTP I am an optimistic cranky fuck? Man that rings true at the moment since im trying to give up caffeine... Although im more Tired and cranky!
I haven't had a best friend since primary school lol I have just a few good mates I do things with occasionally.. They are all extroverts, but I see my introvert mates just as much.   Long story...
Welcome to the fold my friend and hopefully have fun stealing as much knowledge as you can from this site.
Maybe you just need to get a hobby or something? Learning the cello and another language has helped to keep me quite busy (although im a little too busy atm...). So take something up and try to fill...
I've never been able to get into sitcoms that much outside of the realms of Seinfeld.. But doesn't really mean a lot, because I don't watch a lot of tv..
My mums bipolar as well and also an extreme extrovert! Im not sure its type specific, but rather interesting theory nonetheless.
Lol I actually can read my notes.. But no one else can! Wish they had some type writers or something instead of notebooks..
Was planning on refuting this by inserting a number of my favourite witticisms.. Was going to point out the classics on my desk in front of me that I am reading... The fact that I am learning the...
I hate bloody exams.. Seems like most peeps here study some heavily maths or science based subjects.. Me I am just a humble HR business grad and stress heavily when it comes to exams. I usually go...
I think your going through a common transition common to almost all ENTPs and its a path I walked myself when I was your age. It was around this time that I started to discover my intellectual side...
You don't sound like a bad person to me.. Just sounds like you need to refine your social skills a little bit.'
