@themandinator Wow, thanks for that. :) Sounds like the focus of our writing has a lot in common. What about the story problem itself? Is it small scope, like trying to figure out how to survive...
BTW glad to hear other ESTPs write stories. :) Guess we're not as illiterate as people say.
I tried the analyzer thing (hadn't heard of that before!) and a selection of my novel came out as ESFP, an essay came out as INTP, and a blog article came out as ISFP.   So that's an interesting...

Well, judging by what kinds of things she's attentive towards, I'd say Se, but she seems to use them on Ne-type subjects.   What are some examples of non-ESTP interests that you have?
