Well I basically identified as an ISTP 5w6-9w3-3w2 for about four to five years and the thing was that I was very confident with those results. Over time lingering doubts about my thought processes,...

Haha, I don't think I ever thought in terms of being a Nice Kid or not. I wasn't against it, but it wasn't exactly a priority. :)
Honestly, I have this problem also. I really think this is an FP issue! Although my tactic as a kid was to just try to sneak with not doing stuff. I never wanted to debate it.
That's what I keep telling him! Do what I say, then talk all you want! He is going to have to try it and see, LOL.
I suppose it's possible, and if it does, and if I'll need advice based on what he becomes, I'll post a new thread. For now, I'm just looking for guidance based on what he's currently like. :)
If I leave him alone to accomplish any task he will quickly fade away into his own world in his head, which is fun to watch because he acts it out so to speak, but you see in his eyes he's not here...

I'm almost 10 years (happily) married to an INTP. The biggest challenge at first was making sure he remembered to express his love, lol, but now he's very good at it. :)
Also, I remember having trouble growing past certain things as I became an adult because I was afraid to change, since as a kid I was always so proud when people would say to me you're so unique,...
I was originally mistyped as an N because as all my friends and family (who get the personality thingy) say I'm very N for an S :)

Some people may dislike our type, but our type is least likely to value external approval.  I can imagine how that trait conflicts with other type's traits.
It's good for any and every person to know what they can and cannot provide in a relationship.
It hurts . . . so bad  I suppose if we also didn't avoid conflict we may be able to see these characteristics and change them.  Back to my bubble now!
no.  Can an ISFP sum anything up?
I like flirting games
If I have no commitments, my natural sleeping cycle does not align with a 24 hour day and therefore shifts me from being active in the morning to the afternoon to the evening to 3am.

Right wingers do this because they lack political consciousness.

I would agree that both are likely related to confidence levels. It makes sense to me that someone would be aggressive to overcompensate for a (sometimes perceived) shortcoming.
Both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were extremely nationalist. I can't think of a more nationalist country nowadays than the DPRK.  What separates your 'nationalism' from theirs?
You're not the only one, there are plenty of INFPs who are right wing conservatives/alt reich fascists here on PerC.
