I guess somehow that's what I wanted to achieve :)
I would love that, and missanthrope I completely have the same thing as you do, too bad I broke up some while ago -_-
Thats so un INTJ but who gives a damn *hugz (bro style)*
Your joking right? :S
Im an ENFP and im lonely as hell. it sucks, i need people!!
Eeew, so posting my interest in this lovely charactaristic trait is the same as putting a net down, I thought of it like that!
Have you done that allot? Does your daddy know?
Hello everyone,  As you might know ENFP can be very brittle and soft. Even though we can be warm passionate and even fierce at times, we sometimes need a protector.. wait... isn't this part of...
nope, yet i would probably just know.
Your speaking from experience I take it?
Such a foul mouth for such a pretty face, gosh, what would daddy say?
Thank you very much for your kind words of advice and and calming approach, however I can assure you my feelings are not easily hurt at all (im a 21 year old ENFP, if had my share of worldly problems...

Darling, I was willing to consider you, but as you already found when you went to check me out, I was unavailable to you, thus you were dismissed    Please toddle along now.
In think that statement is way too generalising for me to agree on. sorry.
Your debating bored me posts ago, my dear. (the dear part is sincere) Seriously think what makes you happy If the debate was interesting for me we could make an infinite ammount of pages but to be...
I said I didnt choose that line of reasoning to my defense. What part of that did you misinterperit?   Think what makes you happy.
Did you know my dear sarcastic INFJ that according too freudian psychology most things humans do are experiments? Did you also know that Carl G Jung was the one who Inspired Myer Briggs to make the...
Hmm suggesting im a troll simply because you don't catch my viewpoint is quite radical and a bold statement don't you think?
I appreciate your sincerity. Dont take this all too serious however, im having fun dont worry about me ;)

Thanks for your corrections :), they are dearly appreciated. :)

Well I tried to be friends and you obviously don't want too. In my opinion I haven't wronged you in any way and if your going to be sarcastic about it would you mind stepping aside? Thanks dearly...
I'm sorry I didn't inform you earlier. :)
Noted.  Interesting however is the fact that you keep replying to this thread even though you already earlier in this thread clearly indicated your dislike in me and my motives. Which brings me to...

Thanks,  On to the next one.
Great point there. I guess the only thing for me to do is keep talking on this post making it's popularity and amount of hits rise while hoping the woman of my dreams gets enabled by her own thoughts...

I feel the same here.I'm just trying to forget about everything and create my own world.

Definitely an INFP
So what if he turned out to be an ENTJ rather than an INTJ? I don't see the problem with debating, I think you don't like the fact he's criticizing a lot of the things you do.Like not posting certain...
I don't know you but i'd be excited to know you as not much ENTJs are left..so welcome back I guees! :tongue:
I don't get it as ESTPs drain me so much and i'm an extrovert...I just got that you don't like Ne type of enthusiasim if we are going to be specific.
You say you can't stand a person who's enthusiastic yet you can handle ESTPs..That's very funny.
LOL, that is just a stereotype that's not gonna end anytime sooner sadly. Or I can apply that for underdeveloped ENFPs ( I'd hate to say immature) In theory, they're supposed to be the best match if...
LOL there are a lot of INTJ wannabes, they read the description of an INTJ being so smart and leader-like, you know  the mastermind and they just assume it's them when it's what they want to be. ...

How about the ENFP forum? :p Aren't we cute enough to be mentioned? :tongue:

LOL i'd be surprised if any intuitive can share thoguhts freely with a sensing type, it just never works! I tried with different types everytime i'm just like I can't seem to work this out so...
YES.Finally someone said it!! someone who's an INTJ and not another type that you would probably attack cause it's not coming from the same type.
LOL tbh I couldn't ever know how to irritate them while they irritate me on the smallest things :dry:
Well..I've never reached a high-level math to know yet lol..But I've never seen an intuitive that was completely fine with math, there're a lot of sensory things I struggle with and it's so annoying...

lol this post managed to make it smile when I was a bit down XD Good to know that I wasn't alone though! Let's seeeee  - I poked a 10 years old girl's eye (which were really dark and I was kinda...
The test was long lol   All ENFPs for me as well. I don't have any ENFP friends though... I actually quite like Is :D
I agree with almost everything of what others have posted.  There are a few that I wanna add: - people who try to make you jealous - people who take what you said too seriously and be critical -...
The problem with being an ENFP is that sometimes our Ne sees too many possibilities that we can't really make up our mind to fix ourself into a particular field/thing. I'd say try the things that...
I'm such a cry baby that I could cry over the silliest movie like Miyazaki's Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea... I also remember Toy Story 3 before they fell into the furnace and Harry Potter DH1 when...
Excuse me if there is a similar topic on the ENFP forum but I'm not that advanced in searching for posts so I'm not sure...  Anyway, ENFPs~ Are there any myer briggs type that you find it difficult...
Yes. It's changed but she wouldn't know cause we don't really see each other.    If it's gonna be superficial, I think it's better to leave it this way :(
Oh lol I don't think she'll admit her part in this though. Hmm I think it'd be best to wait for her to initiate it (if there'll ever be a chance) so it'd be easy to get things rolling again.    ...
The problem is that I asked her what she wanted upon receiving the present; and once I got the reply that she wasn't changing her mind, I'd also told her straight up that I didn't want her anymore......
In my opinion, friends aren't something that people could 'find' or come across with so easily when they want to, especially when they desire to know someone with specific qualities.  I think some...
Oh believe me, I've also asked myself the same question and even my friends think that it's a good thing that I now have nothing to do with her. But I think it's because of the good times we shared...
Yeah, I was also thinking that only time could change the situation as be both become more mature and perhaps be able to realise what we did back then. Do you mind me asking how did your friend...
I was trying to figure out my career path and I thought why not take a personally test to understand myself more to see what really suits me? So I googled it and MBTI popped up. After confirming that...
Dogs of course!  How can you resist a loyal, sticky, fun, adorable companion? But they require high maintenance...:( What about bunnies?
The list grows as time goes on but Harry Potter will be my all time favourite. and Inception! Very inspiring.
Spiderman or Batman?
... an example of narcissism?
I understand what you mean, don't worry :) We'd once argued about 'promises' and learned that I had to be careful with my choice of words. If she's really lost her trust in me, I don't see there's...
I wish I did that...    Young ENFPs,  Parents' words aren't absolute. Have confidence in yourself and do whatever you think is best for you.
Oh right. That makes things quite clear. I guess it was probably the present which gave me the wrong signal and left me hanging.   Thanks!
Thanks for pointing it out.  So it's best left in the past I guess...
Yeah, I know...that's the problem. I considered the possibility that it wouldn't work unless she is the one who reaches out first, which is quite unlikely. I've figured out a way to avoid conflicts...
I didn't agree with the way she treated me and throwing tantrums so I demanded her to stop and she insisted that that was HER and I should just accept her.
hmmm I see. And I didn't. I was just being demanding. Also, there was something that we couldn't agree on and she disliked me trying to 'change' her...
Hi INTJs! I'm just wondering how firm do you usually stand by your words? Do you change your decision over time?  It's just that there was a fall out between my INTJ best friend and I.  I have to...'

Anything that corners me - that could be someone telling me I shouldn't feel a certain way. I will always stand up and defend myself.
I'm 6 months into a relationship with a beautiful girl - who so happens to be an INFJ as well! Our passion and love is amazing together - it's ecstasy when we're together.   We tend to have a lot...
Happy 420 all - if you are a recreational user that is! I smoked weed everyday for 2 years up til 6 months ago - best decision I ever made to quit!
I did that with an INFJ girl. It paid off, but I have resentment from it and so maybe its not paying off after all.
Being who I am is the best thing that's ever hapnd to me. In fact, I think it only gets better as we get older.
The MBTI is a frame of reference for me - it's proven to be accurate in every turn of my life so far as i've tested it in real life application.
I know she means well and does not have evil intentions, part of is my fault for putting up with a lot of it. I still continue to put up with a good bit I guess - but it's because I know she doesn't...
Yeah - I know logically you are right but it's so hard to do that emotionally. It's so hard to just shatter the possibilities. I'm terrified of the regret.
Well I always told her on the spot that if that's the case, then break up with me. And she would apologize profusely and say she doesn't mean it like that all.   So yeah anything is possible. It's...
Anything is possible.   What I told her is she can lead him on... but it will not make him feel better long term, maybe temporary then she make his recovery getting over him that much harder....
That's just the first bit of it. Some fucked up shit has been said to me. 2 months in she was still talking about being completely in love with her ex. She also told me 2 months in that the ring she...

Fair enough. She has more people in her life than I have in mine oddly enough, I am much more selective in who I let in.   She used to say fucked up things to me like - if I could move back to his...
I've been in a relationship for 4 months at this point with an INFJ. I've known her for years prior and we share a lot in common so align on more than one front - culture, values, ideas, interest,...
Can relate to this entirely!
Edit: realized my friend is ISFJ not ISFP so the comments are not relevant
Well I landed myself in a relationship randomly (when I stopped looking - GO FIGURE!) because it felt right and the girl is amazing (INFJ) - it's been only a few months and things have been going...
My current girlfriend is an INFJ - she's fucking awesome, everything I've ever wanted. She's going thru a hard period in her life but she's worth sticking there for... her negativity does hurt me...

Was addicted to marijuana for 2 years - I smoked anywhere from 1-20 times a day, usually 5-6 lol. I quit (permanently imo) and have not touched it in 3 months now. Amazing to be back to who I am...
Fair enough - well considering the population is generally full of more uneducated persons more than properly educated persons - there is likely many ENFPs out there who have not developed to their...
Fair enough :) to each their own! It is a much cooler story your way :P haha. Online dating ended up not having any success for me - but I did meet a heck of a lot of cool girls which is nice.
1. Does intellect attract you?  Yes  2. Do you care if your mate is smart? Have you ever dated down intellectually?  It's a requirement. I have never dated down, I need someone who can keep up...
Well, I thought the purpose of online dating is for it to lead in to an actual date? For example, I met a girl on an online dating (ENTJ) and she was great, we talked online for 2 weeks - then of...
This thread needs to be stickied - this is the true ENFP, not the damn stereotypical profiles. It's getting annoying now.
One thing - I question the possibility of few hundred million ENFPs because of there were truly a few hundred million real ENFPs (not all the fake tested ones) then the world would be a much...

I'd be open to it. I don't live on the east coast but it would be cool to meet other ENFPs so I'd be happy to make the flight.
Congrats! The first ENFP girl I met was a few months ago and we had electric conversations. We bounced all over the place, it was truly... insane lol. I figured we weren't a good match though because...

That reminds me of the way my parents described me as a baby. I also didn't have a permanent grin, I tended to cry a lot I was told. And super, super moody and sensitive.
Personally, I think that's not a good route to take. I think ENFPs can make amazing lawyers - in fact I was going to be one and I had many many lawyers recognize that passion in me. One of the career...

I feel like this is the most accurate description of how I relate to being an ENFP I've ever seen. And it's not even meant to be a description lol
Well in my generalized experience, I would make the exact same general observation :proud:
Good to have you back :) I'm a little bit new here, and not particularly active, but sometimes I just have things I want to say.

Yo! It totally makes sense that Fe could make someone really cynical if they're surrounded by the wrong people.

I agree. And I've seen it the other way as well, where an intuitive mistypes as a sensor for similar reasons. Honestly it goes both ways pretty evenly.
Read my posts throughout this thread and you will understand my point of view. The original post was intended to express an idea that I wanted to have expanded upon. Also, when I noticed that I made...
Well, it is a very subjective experience, so what are the most important traits to you?
Yes! You're doing it for the love! :glee:
I guess you could just go ahead and check all of the boxes lol :tongue:
Totally stealing this from the INFP forum ;P But I want to know. Who do think ENFPs should date?  I am typically along the lines of 'it doesn't matter as long as they fulfill each others needs'....
I would do skype but, I don't make a very good online friend :P I'm better at being a friend in person.  Also I'm an ENFP so I'm intruding here xD
I would say ENFJ from real life experience. Not just cause of functions. But their Fe compliments Fi VERY well. My brother is an ENFJ and his two best friends INFPs and he knew exactly how to make...

Thank you! I feel like you really understand what's going on in my mind.
Hey, I think you just explained my exact world views word for word. Although you enunciated yourself much better than I might have if I tried to explain it.
It totally makes sense. And, when an introverted type is in public, they usually use their second function as their front so it's normal for an introvert to come across as their extroverted...'

yeah, women are beautiful for the most part white or otherwise  I like jewish girls a lot, if I had to pick a type, but it's not important to me
>True happiness  lel  (note: the following is very stream of consciousness, and contradicts itself at least twice. I'll fix it up)  Trust me dude, assuming you are a middle class suburbanite,...
Bill's is overrated, I say stick with your tossle unless its something dumb like flies or bolts. Get a track terrorizer for B instead of spooky sleeves
Do I think I have a tritype? Sure Do I know what it is? No Do I think I'll ever get an objective reading? Not really  I'll think about it though. I'm an ENFP type 8, that's cool enough for me to...
No, I feel ya. Type 8 seems very T-ish, but it is my understanding of myself that I am an 8. I'm much less sensitive than other ENFP's. It's hard to hurt my feelings. I'm not going to bother trying...
Not even true. We're rare, but it happens. Just because most of the ENFP's are lackadaisical ragamuffins doesn't mean all of us are.    hmm, I ought to change that
You left out me! :@
I dunno, I'm with [strike]Flame Princess[/strike} Ace Face over there, I think personality assessments are sort of frivolous; sure they can be neato, but it leads to a lot of false positives    ...
Nah, I don't think it would change anything. I personally am entirely accepting of people's strange attractions; one of my closest friends is an INFJ and a zoophile
I like talking about sex but... really? Salt n pepa? for shame.
nah, you've got it all wrong, three ESFP's walk into a bar and everyone else goes around it (<3 you, ESFP's)    Churchill, Abraham Lincoln, Suleyman, (I'm running out of dead politicians that I...
Here I am, once again trying to return to PerC after getting bored so many times because everybody talks about the same stuff always  But I love you guys, so who wants to talk about something...
So to post again, it's been a very enlightening summer. Gotta thank Swordsman of Mana for giving me a bit of perspective; you're totally right, it's fucking easy as a straight guy to find someone....
fengshui222 Use your Ne to appear like you know how to enjoy life. You know that phrase, dance like nobody is watching? Live by it. You should be letting it all hang out. Pull it off right, and...
Smiley, that's a fucking wallll of text.
Ah, yeah. I lose :(
Meh. I just like girls. But she was something special, and I am complacent enough to bide my time and masturbate  Yeah, I'm lucky, I just have to be confident and charming. It's just that I get...
Swordsman of Mana sorry to hear that. Getting really attached to somebody isn't that strange. There's this INFJ (apparently she also is a MBTI-user. Dunno if she's on PerC) that I met in a summer...
... the joke was that you were quoting rarity.
Might I add that a particularly rare kind of girl would say that?
Fixed that for ya'
As far as Avatar is concerned, I'm filled with notions of balance and energy.  That's how I prefer to think of it.'
'So...if this thread already exists someplace else (which it does:  how the heck to I delete this one here???
Ooops...I guess I didn't look too hard because I just started a Movies every ENFP should watch thread...
So, this came up in the You Know You're An ENFP When... thread.  (@Pucca :  here we go!  IT IS DONE :D) This isn't a list of films with ENFPs IN them, but rather ones that you believe ENFPs would...

[QUOTE=Pucca;2951774]I've never seen it.:shocked:QUOTE]  Me, neither.   Guess we should have a Movie Marathon of All Movies ENFPs Should Watch. :D
That's hilarious. hahaha I used to pretend I had a bunch of dragon friends and a whole bunch of animals (like platypi and octopi and ocelots, and horses, etc.) I was always rescuing my dragons from...
WOOO!  I'd love to be the TARDIS! :D
This is from my signature (actually, just look at all the quotes in my signature)  I am a forest, and a night of dark trees: but he who is not afraid of my darkness, will find banks full of roses...
I'm not quite that bad either (and counting sheep doesn't work for me because I get distracted and numbers are not my strong point).  It does take me a long time to fall asleep even when I'm tired. ...
Rune: That is an awesome photo/e-card.  I love it!  It is so true! :D
I'm an ENFP (and a 4w5).  I'm conflicted on the subject. :3  I like to say This Is Me, but at the same time, I don't want to be put in a box, or have a label or stereotype applied to me.  I like...
I like how people can discuss things when they don't agree.  This begins to seem like people arguing rather than discussing and some of the comments are a bit mean-spirited and undiplomatic (No...
Because I don't like editing--it's my least favorite part of the writing process, I sort of edited while I went.  Kind of.  And then read through it once to make sure everything made sense and there...
Hey there! :D  Welcome and enjoy the forums!!! :D
So I already posted about my conversation style and merely touched upon editing my writing without going into it.  This is going to be the third time/thread I've posted this, but here we go: I love...
Yeah, I'd say my conversation/speaking style is meandering as well! :D hahaha I love writing and took a lot of English classes (I eventually decided that I wanted to be an English teacher and so I...
I was thinking of being an English teacher for a while and so I have had many writing classes.  I think @ChanceyRose is correct about people's writing styles depending upon the teacher.  One of my...
I think I (an ENFP) tend to just keep going when I'm trying to get a point across that I know I'm not verbalizing well.  (When I'm speaking....if it's an essay or something, then I edit and...
Usually, I stick to one book at a time (not including what I used to have to read for school), but lately I've been reading several books at once.  Currently, I'm re-reading Tolkien's THE HOBBIT. ...
Dear Anonymous(es)  Clearly you did not recieve my last letter.  Or you did not understand it.  I assume this because it has been a week and NO ONE HAS HIRED ME OR EVEN CALLED ME BACK.  Look, I...
I don't think I was being sarcastic...sometimes it happens when I didn't intend it though. :)  Hufflepuff is from Harry Potter.  It's one of the four dormitories houses in the castle.  Each...
agreeeeeeeed!!!!!! :d
Fluffy can be strong, too.  :3  I know what you mean though.  We're champions and we inspire people.  But why can't we be silly and fun-loving and affectionate as well?  I'm not saying every ENFP...
I also found it interesting, but what about if you are on a medication that changes the chemicals/hormones in your brain?  Wouldn't that mean that your personality would change as well (according to...
I realize that being nice and being fair are not mutually exclusive.  I would hope that people try to be both!  However, someone posed the question to me where you HAD to pick one and I was curious...
--Sincerity/being genuine/honesty:  don't try to be someone you're not because you think I'll like you better.  I'd much rather see/hear the real you.  I like differences in people and so I'd want to...
Just because you're not the only one, doesn't mean you're not crazy. :P  You're just crazy in good company! :D <3
No problem, darlin. :D  I love meeting/welcoming new people!
Welcome and have fun posting!! :D I am also an ENFP.
I've never been professionally diagnosed but I've had many people ask me if I have it.  *shrug*  I think it's because like so many ENFPs, I go off on tangents when I tell stories or explain something...
Is it better to be Fair or to be Nice? Explain and discuss your answers. :D  Have fun!
Is it better to be Fair or to be Nice?  Explain and discuss your responses. :D  Have fun!
ENFP Hufflepuff! :D   And proud of both!   And I think people stereotype too much with this.  I think any type can be in any house.  There is value in every house! :D
I hate shopping!  Unless it's at a bookstore, Renaissance Faire, or a Sci-Fi con dealer's room.  I get bored and frusterated when I'm shopping for clothes, shoes, or anything else because it's...
Okay, I agree with the every-and-none personality type. Or borderline on everything...  But I thought it would be fun to type him/her/any-variation-there-upon if he/she exists (or existed or...
Yeah, I'm thinking you're going to have to do some heavy lifting hahaha.  On the other hand, the reading might interest you and then it won't seem so heavy.   Also, we're more than just lables...
Oh, wow!  Because I was totally guessing... couldn't tell you exactly WHY I thought that based on your reading.  :3  I mean, I couldn't cite specific instances (except for the two that I pointed out...
Words: You are amazing/awesome/fascinating. I love how/when you ___. I love you. You're so interesting. You're inspirational You have such good ideas. You're an excellent writer....
I LOVE the teddy bear metaphor!  Great analogy!  I'm stealing it. ;P
Bienvenue!  :D  Have fun in the forums and good luck figuring out yourself and your direction/desires!
A friend--or two--in my area (I recently moved halfway across the country).  And a fulfilling job.
Okay...this is just a guess, but maybe ENTP?  I don't know enough about the cognitive functions to back it up that way, but here's the reasonign behind my guess: N because you talked about how you...
I'm not very good with functions and picking out which function I'm using at which time. So do you think you could say which things were Ne in my responses?  Maybe then I can learn to pick up other...
I knit or do some other craft (as long as the craft is simple and doesn't have a complicated pattern).  Or I'll listen to one while driving or doing chores that are physical only with no need for...

That's true...sort of! hahah, it goes in cycles for me.  Spurts of interest. :D
Dear Anonymous(es),  You should hire me.  I'd be a great asset.  It IS possible to be fun-loving/lightheatrted AND professional.  And trust me, I am NOT over/underqualified.  I'm sorry you found my...
