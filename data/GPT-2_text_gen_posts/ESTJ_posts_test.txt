'Fellow artist,  I apologize for failing to acknowledge your poetic side before today. I wish you the best of luck.   -Posh Eagle
Thank you for your faith in me. You are a true peer.   I am of the opinion that changing your type requires a significant amount of planning and determination. As you may know, I will only become...
What a fine piece of art. I find it to represent my inner self. Thank you.   I might make it my new avatar.   -Posh Eagle
Fellow bird, wonderful to see you again. I am glad you admit this. Thankfully we both get to enjoy the reign of our new leader.     This does not represent me.  -Posh Eagle
Dear ENTPs,   I genuinely hope you are as well and feisty as ever. I am sure all of you have paid attention to the results of the presidential election in the United States.   As most of you...
Laughing may not have been your finest idea. Even if she is not an ENTP, she can easily become one in a reasonable number of years. I assumed you would have learned that from interacting with me. I...
Today is a remarkable day - the anniversary of my joining here. I am well aware of the fact that I have gained an excellent reputation among you forum peers. Unfortunately, this is not always the...
I will become an INTJ  That is at least what I think has scared away my dates.  -Posh Eagle
Well said, peer. It is pleasant to see us birds all teamed up.   -Posh Eagle
You are truly interesting. Do you believe that Cher is a source of objective information? In addition, if his sayings have been found as obnoxious by the writer it does not mean they are. If I was to...
There is no need to insult me. I have done nothing but discussed.   Would you be so kind and give me concrete evidence for his obnoxiousness? I truly am curious. You may find his behavior as such,...
I would like to know how you were planning to measure Mr. Trump's objective level of obnoxiousness. I must say that I find him rather charming.   -Posh Eagle
There are days when I feel mighty and dangerous, yet I would not consider myself a threat to this nation. Thus I am confident that Mr. Trump is not the worst of all options.   -Posh Eagle
It seems to me that you are the one lacking common sense.   May the best man win.   -Posh Eagle
If I was you, I would not trust ENTPs. They have ruined several of my threads. I was not pleased. However, you may be grateful for my two cents: do what your heart tells you to do.   Looking back,...
My peers have also stated that my formality is a guilty pleasure. I strongly disagree. It seems rather obvious to me that it is the other way around, despite the fact that very few people seem to...
I understand your point. I am still of the opinion that I have the right to define myself. For example, my peers have every right to call their interests guilty pleasures. However, they cannot...
I am not pleased when someone judges my interests. For example, the reception has not been positive when I have informed my peers about the fact that I like to watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians....
An interesting incident happened to me the other day. Me and my peers were trying to decide on a date to study together. I told them that this Thursday would not suit me as I had already made plans...
Thank you for your apology. I accept it. We can be peers again.  -Posh Eagle
Thank you for your kind compliment. I strongly believe that my Ni has developed recently and that I am thus one step closer to becoming an INTJ in 2021.   It might be the time to change my type to...
Excuse you, but you are clearly mistaken. If you have the nerve to mock me, it should not be too much to ask that you did it correctly. First of all, I have stated multiple times that I am an ESTJ....
As a future NT I will take this as a compliment.   -Posh Eagle
It still does not make me any less legal.   -Posh Eagle
You truly understand my soul. However, I must point out that since I am eighteen years old I am definitely an adult.   -Posh Eagle
I can only assume that I am the former one. However, do not underestimate yourself, fellow bird. I am sure the likes of you have their place in the world.   -Posh Eagle
Fellow bird, I see that you resemble a parrot as much as I am similar to an eagle.   -Posh Eagle
It seems to me that being an ENTP is ultimately worth it.   -Posh Eagle
Overrated: Anything that is given too much credit and hype.  This is from Urban Dictionary. The credit or hype revolving around being an SJ comes from the society. I dare you to be proud and...
If you say so. I must say that being an SJ is overrated.     I would not be so sure. Have you?   -Posh Eagle
I am always prepared. You should consider becoming an ESTJ. My future intuition says that it would be a suitable goal for you to be reached in 2024.   -Posh Eagle
As a matter of fact I do.   -Posh Eagle
I felt that this thread was in a desperate need of my two cents.   -Posh Eagle
Dear Queen,   I truly understand your need to lead the ENTP peers. I am also a natural leader. Rise above the peasants and rule if you wish so, I am sure you are capable of that.   It hardly...
I personally do not understand why you are invading the INFJs who are likely to accept you with open arms. It seems like a rather easy task for me. I was under the impression that ENTPs are fond of...
Fellow bird, could you be a dear and summarize your current strategy? I merely skimmed through the thread and it was not evident enough.   -Posh Eagle
I am glad we can discuss bird to bird. I must say that my extended absence was very unfortunate and hopefully will not happen again.     How can I be of assistance?   -Posh Eagle
I see that you are trying to troll me. However, I am not threatened by your actions. I am a strong and independent peer.   -Posh Eagle
I believe the word you are looking for is combined, not intertwined, my peer. You might benefit from checking that the lyrics are correct before quoting them.   -Posh Eagle
Do not make such a move on me. There will be consequences.      Thank you for your kind...
I am glad that my attention is this important to you. Fellow bird, it truly makes me feel special.     You might want to reconsider your statement. Parrot greatly reminds me of an ENTP, whereas I...
Fellow bird, I appreciate the fact that you are this devoted to me. I want to assure that having multiple peers myself does not make you an any less valuable one.   -Posh Eagle
You might want to reconsider your trust on conspiracy theories.   However, thank you for your deep respect for me. I am delighted to know that peers like you exist.  -Posh Eagle
I am glad that there is a real NT who shares my interest in Mr. Trump. I truly hope the best man wins the election.   In addition, the fascination you express for eagles is inspiring.   -Posh...
Thank you, peer. I feel flattered.    Here you have my autograph. It will be very valuable in 2019. My novel will be published then. Unfortunately I could not...
Fellow bird, glad to see that you are still around. I am thankful for your advice.     Thank you for the long reply. I aim for everyone taking me and my list of goals seriously. You can read more...
I must say that I sense sarcasm here. I am still grateful for your interest in my posts.   In addition, I would like to point out that you should have said your level of commitment instead of...
What can I say, I have faith in everyone regardless of whether they deserve it. I truly hope that this time I will not have to regret my decision to trust ENTPs.   -Posh Eagle
Based on my previous experience, I did not think that the day would come when I turn to ENTPs for advice again. However, here we are.   I have noticed that many of my ENTP peers are eccentric yet...
Greetings, fellow ESTJs and others using this forum. What have I missed during my unfortunate absence?   I am glad to inform you all that I am planning on being significantly more active here. I...'

I'm not exaggerating, I could prove it's defective butt that'd get me in trouble round here.
Okay I get your rationality INFJ, butt why can't we have both boobs & butts?   
ESTJ's butt is cracked & has a hole in it.
This one's for you BlackFandango, you INFJs just gotta love Donald Trump.

There's no hurry to awaken the Army Of the dead & slay all enemies, so maybe you'd set your sights upon a mere revolution to bring awareness of just how ridiculous the stereotypical unhealthy...
I'd say sure you can self nominate for VP & I'd suggest inviting maust for daily tea & pastries, she's almost like family round these ESTJ threads.
Yes apparently I do, by more than 15 years. I'd vote for Pinina to become king of the ESTJs

And are you satisfied with what you've been doing...?
Indeed it sucks to stay in the house all summer. The thing is mate, I'm much older than he is and I do many things that are illegal for him.
It's summer and my 16 year old brother has never left the house. He says his friends bore him and all his does is watch online videos, draw, and play his guitar.  Any insights?

I think people would stay on and join these kinds of forums if they are more informative. I rarely use the internet for entertainment; I use it mainly for research.
I agree Lance. They are very attractive.
And yes, I think this is stupid because you can only judge on someone after interacting with him or her in person.
Wow, I did not know I was missed guys :happy:. However, I normally don't spend a lot of time on the computer when I'm home for the summer. I hope to see you two in the chatroom sometime though.
I can't say for all because I don't know all ESTJs.
One of my buddies at work told me that I have a fucked up mind when I said it would be a waste of money if we got off work early because I had bought myself $5 worth of food on top of my normal lunch...
Excellent.  To be honest, I'm lacking with the forum myself these days. :tongue:

I get REALLY annoyed with the exact same things you listed and because I am an extrovert, I frequently say exactly what I think. YIKES!! I get myself into hot water on a regular basis! If you figure...
You don't understand why everybody gets mad when you suggest a RATIONAL solution when they are all about the emotional.
You have a cow when somebody wants to change the game plan at the last minute!'
'As a personal challenge, I like to pick up characters that are very different in style, looks and personalities each time I cosplay or do a murder partie. But my favorite characters, those I feel...
...Dang, that's true. XD Though I'm mostly the funny, obnoxious, flirty, clumsy type of drunk :wink:
I agree. I even get really snappy if you try to reach my Fi.    I disagree with that, mostly. I agree with the lack of patience with people not acting fast enough, not doing what we expect them...
I don't know. Is there a way to use this? I've always felt that as much as possible, I'd ignore it and use my reason.   But for the Ne, because mine is pretty developped, it's actually pretty easy...
About the subject on competition, I have to say, I'm a sore loser, and an even worse winner. Don't play with me. Seriously. Alright, so I don't always mind loosing if the game was interesting and I...
Hum, there's one expression I use all the time, a french one, because I'm french, it goes:  c'est en forgeant qu'on devient forgeron Which means it's by crafting that you become a blacksmith....
That's because we're control freaks, so having someone invade our private space without our consent and trying to overpower us by initating something intimate, that's just, NO!
Nope, not at all. I just like to watch them cry XD
Give in. ESTJs are always right anyway. Why fight against superior power?   Of course I'm just kidding XD Yes, be honest, don't turn this into a drama and offer them something to drink afterward....
Put a leash on SPs, Lock NTs in labs and NFs in our bedroom. Leave the rest to the SJs. Now the world would be great like that.
Again, I agree with WickedQueen. I would think that ESTJs are too righteous, blunt and straightforward to even bother with something like manipulation. It's more a take it or leave it. I...
Agreed with WickedQueen. ESTJs generally accept their mistakes and shortcoming graciously, and are willing to get better if help is offered. Now we all know typing kids is not that easy, but I think...
Hum, my best friend is XSTJ. People have always wanted to stick us together, we've always protested. I don't think it's impossible for ESTJ and ISTJ to be friends. We jst need not to try to convince...
6 months before what? Cause if it's lung cancer, I'd say goodbye and kill myself on the spot, not wanting to bother anyone with the burden of watching me get worse and worse everyday. (I say lung...
Hum, I feel sorry for what happened to WickedQueen. That would have made my blood boil pretty hard, and when you make my blood boil, you really better run away fast. Seriously. Alright so I'll try to...
I completely agree with that. Being overprotective is not necessarily the way to go. My parents were fairly strict when I was a kid, taught us hos to be polite, respectful, well-behaved. As a...
Only NTs would want to include chemistry in a rlationship... Ok that joke is pretty bad XD Seriously though, I fail at relationships because the chemistry is always one-sided. I decided to stop...
Welcome to the forum yourself, then ^^. Enjoying it so far?
I just came back from a long, tiring week-end, and seeing your message, the only thing that crossed my mind is hum, only a NF would greet someone saying hiya  so I checked, turned out I was...
I personally think that giving hugs is much easier (to friends at least) than receiving them.
Sorry, not being american, I've got no idea what SWMBO is XD Of course I'm not saying that there's no valid point to your argument, but I've got troubles believing in One True Love, for me it's more...
Talking about money reminds me of two things: Dunno about other ESTJs, but for me, it's much, much easier to lend money than borrow some. I only borrow money from my XSTJ best friend, and never paper...
I completely (dare I say heartfulle...? naaaah XD) agree with Krustray, and I'm touchy-feely too XD Seriously, though, it's easy enough to figure out: An ENTJ will only bother with stuff that...
Thanks and hello to you too ^^
...Is it me or is there a lot of NFs here...? Anyway XD, thanks for the welcome, and yes, very much so! Actually, none of my friend know about MBIT, and I'm always talking about it to them, but as...
XD Well, good luck with that. But I'm sure your mate had to learn not to be too abrasive as well XD
My Te has been pointed out again today. I called a girl to tell her she didn't need to take the changing booth break, I would do it for her, but even though it was to help her and not at all for my...
Che, of course an ENTP would be the first one to do that XD But sadly, no, this time wasted on this stupid but notheless awesome site IS carefully planned in my schedule, sorry XD  Also, I...
Even ESTJs need breaks occasionally. And when you're a good ESTJ, you know how to plan your time perfectly well and arrange for breaks. Like, my week is epic, lots and lots of things to do. I managed...
An NT teacher must be fairly rare. I know I've got no tolerance for stupid people either. I've got a lot of patience, but stupidity annoys me pretty fast. One pf the reason I thought I was ENTJ at...
Well, we always talk about how we consider work as play, but there's also the other way around: play as work. Like how right now I have to do 3 paintings (just finished the second one) for the murder...
Agreed. Though personally, unless pissed drunk, I wouldn't be able to have sex out of boredom or loneliness (being an SJ, I'm rarely ever bored anyway XD Lonlely it happens, but then we have a big...
That's one of the thing I really don't like about our current society: on one side you have people that treat sex overly-casually, and on the other, those that make such a big deal out of it. Moraly...
Really? How long have you been married? What type is she? ^^
So, because you seemed to know more about it than me, and I din't like to state facts without knowing well my subject, I made some research.  First, I never said that it was a good idea to have sex...
* I would say one, but maybe there's more, at least on some level some might. * My best friend, known him for 9 years, when I was 15, and have been flatmates 5 years. * He hasn't taken the test...
well, I'd really like to meet some and hear their point of view on this. Seems really interesting. I hope for them they are able to hold true to their wedding vows and aren't overcome by curiosity...
Respect for the person you are marrying? I fail to see how learning more about yourself, your own body, and not in a sleep-with-everything-I-find way, but connect-to-the-person-I-love way, because...
Actually, if a condom is not of poor quality and doesn't rip, and if you don't do other stuff that I'm not sure I'm allowed to speak here, as you mentioned, there's young people reading that, there's...
I'm not saying it never works out. There's one true fact: no matter how many times and with how many different partner you have sex, you never forget your first. And for women, it's a very strong...
Well, I've met girls that wanted to wait until marriage, but never guys, never on websites, never on TV shows. So I can't say much about them. They must exist, but I'm under the impression that it's...
alright so as an atheiste ESTJ I will give my opinion:   1) Do you believe in sex before marriage? Yes. And stop with the STD talk. That's what condoms are for. Now, I'm not a good exemple. I had...
XD Exactly. Yep, ESTJ stereotype, and because I am an ESTJ, as funny as I tried to make this sound, it's sadly so very true XDD And of course ENTJ wouldn't care about clothes and promote thinking by...
Thanks you dear ESFP (now that rises my curiosity that applies for all SPs: What kind of art do you perform?)
Yours scream ENTJ, but as smart, cool, good-looking, whatever, Light is, I certainly hope you're not set on taking over the world by becoming the new God like he is :laughing:  (actually, we...
I'm quite ok with death by burning, actually. Especially if it was revenge for having locked every NF I could find in my torture chamber and have my well-deserved fun with them *smirk*  Don't...
XD Such an NF reaction :laughing: Don't worry darling, I've dealt with NFs all my life (mom, sis and bro are NFs) and I've become quite good at avoiding to make them cry. well, on pupose anyway. I...

Too late. You belong tu us now, mouahahaha!!    Mostly because I know I'm right and what was said had to be said. There's no room for feelings in factual truth.    my sister cried 6 times...

With that approach you could just call it The Curb and have separate subsections for plastic, glass, metal, and yard waste.  Kicked to the curb would take on new meaning here.
You're both wrong. It's not a waste of money, because you can probably save the $5 worth of food (what can you buy for $5 anymore, can't even buy a sandwich for that most places?) and eat it later....
