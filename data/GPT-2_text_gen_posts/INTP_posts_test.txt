I am specifically curious as to why the enneagram puts emphasis on healthy and unhealthy versions of the types appearing like other types? Like, for example, why a disintegrating 5 will look like an...
Im a Christian (Jehovah's Witness) and an INTP. I can't speak for other Christian religions, but I am the only INTP Jehovah's Witness on this forum that I know of. I have met a few in real life...
Im still new to this theory, and so the only comment I can really make is that I see alot of myself in these descriptions, for all three types, though mainly the 5. Thanks for posting.
MBTI just tells you what your preferences are. INTP is, for us, the baseline of our behaviour. We generally act and think this way, therefore we're classified as this. That doesn't mean we can't step...

You sound very much like my step mother and sister in law, both of whom are INFJ. I would be inclined to say you are such.  I cant say on the ennegram though as I still dont know much about it.
Nice to have you, West Nile Virus.  I don't feel quite comfortable answers those sorts of questions on such a public forum, especially as this one is meant for those who are not witnesses, but would...

The theories on his type are ESTP, ESTJ or maybe ISTP.  I'll just start rambling about whatever comes to mind.... Heh.   I had once assumed him to be introverted because he has told me stories of...
This post seems very ENTJ to me.  I was thinking ENTJ as I read through the OP as well, but this post confirmed that for me. I think an ESFP at the age of 12 would not be nearly as articulate or...
I would be more inclined to go with ENFJ over ENFP so I would suggest looking into the ENFJ profile. Or possibly ENTJ. You seem to be sort of in the middle. I could rule out the P in your case with...

It is indeed bullshit.  I like ISFJ's.  If I was not married to an ESFJ I would probably be married to an ISFJ.

Not from what I've seen.  I think you are a very effective communicator.  Also very interesting as well.
Why do you like ISTJ's?  I mean, I respect them a lot, they are dependable, hard working, and solid.  But think INTJ+ISTJ would be painfully boring.
I don't think there is anything wrong with it.  I hope that it works out well for you and that you find happiness.     Is your INTP going to have part time lovers?  What about your extra lovers, is...
It's interested to see an ISFJ admit this.  I don't think monogamy is natural.  None of us just stop noticing others after marriage.  However, most of us have a need for love and security in our...
Oh.  He sounds like an ass.  Sorry.
This is fascinating coming from an ISFJ.  I've always viewed ISFJ's as very monogamous.  I can't tell if you have a craving for multiple lovers or if you are just frustrated that your relationships...

I'm glad it's working out for you.
I'm not surprised that an ISTP does not think we are emotionless.  I agree we are not.  I work with an ISTP and he has a reputation for being tactless and brutally honest.  The ESFJ and ESTJ here...

I've been told that I'm all or nothing.  Maybe it's a common trait in INTJ's.  I think we're stubborn in our ideas as well.  I'm a believer myself.  I firmly believe in God.  I can respect the...
That's not an odd question.  Sounds like a valid concern about your health.  I've never heard of pinching the breast being super painfull though.
Okay I concede.  People who spend a lot of time on forums are not necessarily weird or awkward.  I have to remind myself that most of you are younger and single.  That makes a huge difference.
That's what happens when you are socially impaired AND extroverted.
Sorry.  I'm sure you are smarter than me and much more talented in my ways.  Anybody that would pick an avatar like that is obviously very sexy.  The crowds are probably lined up by now to have a...
I really should not say this but I'm going to.  This post gave me a boner.  Never in my life have I been so flattered.
Wow funny OP.  I loved it.    We are only gods on the INTJ dominated internet forums.  In the real world we are often geeks and losers, virgins and socially awkward.  INTJs flock to INTJ forms on...
It's good to know I'm not the only one.
I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned socionics yet.  The primary emphasis in socionics is interpersonal relations.  If you are INTJ in MBTI then there is a good chance that you are also INTj in...

You might be a pederast.
My #1 frustration is that I think too much and do too little.  I want to be more of a doer and I want to be more productive at work and at home.
I've been married to an ESFJ for 10 years.  It's been good, really good actually.

pretty simple, as a Ti-dom I operate on Ti/Fe which makes Te/Fi into a nightmare for me.
There is no Universe, only the Flat Earth.
there are no Aliens, Earth is Flat
Ignore the MBTI Surface and grab your lead function from Jung. 
I take that back.
Sorry the MBTI fucked with my brain, I was correct on Fe the whole time and get theoretically sidetracked with my own understanding. She is Fe-dom.
translation into MBTI
It doesn´t matter if they try to describe the same thing they both fail with the functions as these can be described such and such. Socionics makes clear rules and MBTI isn´t going anywhere near deep...
There is no Se-Ni axis or whatever functions you try to merge here as a Socinics ESTp is a MBTI ESTJ.
ENTj=ENTP
I am not saying that Socionics Te is MBTI Ne I was just showing that translation works with the surface and the J/P switch for Extraverts.
The functions aren´t the same, the surface however is the same. Only one thing needs to be done and that is to change the last letter for Extraverted Socioncs Types and the translation to MBTI is...

I mean of course in some way introversion abstracts from the Object but you could say it the other way around. You could also use the word intangible for abstract in contrast to concrete. Se for...
even if YOU think that way the original is still ambigous
Jungs Te description is crap and his Ti description is a NiTi description with nearly not any Ti in it.ö
Outside/Inside here means Concrete/Abstract its just another way to look at it.
I don´t see anything wrong with it so yes.
lol I don´t understand a word you are saying - sorry mate
Gravity is the concept with the mass and the pull and I don´t buy the momentum Bullshit. Its assumed that there is Infinite Space in the first place.
What does a planet do when it falls off a plane? It makes itself around the world due to gravity.

Thats Fe in the 1st or 2nd position.
A simple change of the temperament letters (NT/SF, NF/ST) shows the opposite type based on cognitive functions on which the MBTI is based on.
One the other hand Ni is limited to Se exploration as it can´t see hidden things like Ne as Ni is just a subjective perception and therefore not that direct/immediate as Ne is.
well I see the doubt as a drive, you feel that something is off and needs to be understood, explored however you wanna call it

There is no way that you value Fi/Te, I don´t consider Socionics as the System is a huge mess with the Reinin stuff and all that crap.
