Ladda Land (2012) a Thai movie. It was something about ghosts. And out of all horror movies that I watched it was one of the few which I found really creepy.

Things ISTPs don't find fun? Dumb questions.
It is a scientific fact that women speak in a higher pitch to men that they are attracted to. It is because higher voice means more fertile which will appeal to their natural hormones as well.
I think they make a lot of typing errors personally. I notice ones that I am like UHM NO! lol
LOL I like this thank you. :-)
LOL I'm an ESFJ does site owning seem like a likely career choice?  No. I don't. I'm feeling like mostly xNTJs have this paranoia.

LOL Perfect rationalization. Should they change their ENFJ description to everything you just said? LOL
It's fun! lol I agree. Enjoy it for what it is. But there are a lot of Disney heroines so it is possible. Disney likes to make variations, so that they don't get called out for only having one type...
I disaree with every single on of your typings though lol How even do you come about those? Cinderella is stereotypical ISFJ. Mulan possible INFJ if she isn't ISTJ. Aurora is also perfectly ISFP....

I actually tend to agree with this. XNTP have Ti Ne...they at least are aware of the possibilities and capable of analyzing them to figure out a much more logical approach. Sometimes y'all analyze a...

Welcome!
For sure... read them all, and then decide for your self!  I realized there was a misguided portion of my young adult life (15+ years ago) where I mapped out as an ISFJ and then about 10 years later...
Welcome!!!  :)
So, here's a followup then.... what is the practical difference (that people have experianced in real life) between an ISFP and ISFJ.
I agree.  I read through that, and the one thing I appreciated MOST of my ISFJ was when she'd finally OPEN UP to me and tell me what was wrong.  It give me a chance to actually do something to help...
I'm looking for perspective from females on just what makes them tick in relationships?  What are turn ons, what are turn offs.  What give you feelings of security or loneliness?  I'm an ESFJ, and...

Welcome!  :)
Great read!  Check out the type 2 sub forum.  I have my entire story that brought me here in there.  Perhaps you'd have some words of wisdom from a different perspective.
Welcome!  Well written!
Not sure, but it tells me you're defining yourself still.  I STARTED growing up as an ISFJ, then an INTJ.. then I realized through my experiences in life I ranked out as an ESFJ.  You'll find that...
Welcome man!
That pretty much sums us up.  Best friends, but with passionate benefits.  I know we truly loved though.  Had planned and talked about marriage until the pressures of the last year really got to us....
Thought I'd stop in and say hi!  I've really taken to this site, as a means of growth with like minded people who get each other.  I know I'm done feeling the way I do sometimes and have embraced...

I used to frequent another forum years ago and just find forums to be compiled of introverts. Perhaps some ESFJs don't have the time or patience to be active on a forum. I go through my moments when...
Oh yeah for family.. hm. Take her to a favorite restaurant of hers. If you know she's into something like birds, or zombies, or flowers (I have no idea what your aunt is into and I'm being random...

Omg this is the best question ever! Seriously, good work. Now, expect a novel.. ;)   All joking aside, some ways to show appreciation from my experience (and keep in mind I'm currently dating an...
I always feel like we are hated, so its nice to meet someone who appreciates us! Thank you!   I take the MBTI test every few months to make sure I am maybe not some other ESxx type. Always ESFJ.
Yay! You are my forum twin! ESFJ here, dating an INTP for past 1.5 and you couldn't have worded it better: best person I know. We've had our ups and downs (and downs aren't even really 'down' like...
You couldn't have explained it any better. I swear you could write a book about this pairing and I'd buy and read it all the time.   I finally (after much obvious realizations and going from living...
Curious what happened (if you don't mind me asking). Very similiar situation I'm in and we have known and dated each other for over a year (took awhile for us to be like 'ok we are together right?...
The INTP I'm dating (and have observed over the past year and half) is so much like this.   I'm an ESFJ and the OP sounds a bit like me honestly. My INTP has friendships from when he was in HS and...
As someone not new to this forum, or INTPs, this is all hilarious.   I think I'd be annoyed too if I were an INTP to be coming across thread after thread on How do i know if INTP loves me?. :)
lol I follow that author, Heidi Priebe on fb - she's awesome! A few times she has even replied back in a comment!!   And yes, I needed to read that. So true. Thank you!
Couldn't agree more, Mollusk.   As much as I always kind of wanted an outgoing Exxx type, I now know after meeting different types of people, I just feel more myself and love my surroundings when...
Yes, so true!   So far, the best match (lately as I grow older) has been INTP I've been seeing on/off for 16 mos now (things seem to be back 'on'). The reassurance I get from is whenever he spends...
all of this yes!!!
I can seriously read anything and everything you write. Its amazing.   Okay, that being said, everything you described puts my INTP into more I than E. I think because I'm 'in' he just feels SO...
Man, sorry to hear this. I sometimes feel my assertive, sometimes 'over the top teasing' ways with my INTP could lead to damaging him but he knows he can always talk to me if there were any problems....

Yeah I kind of feel this way to be honest. I may be jam packed on a Saturday but then I need sunday to just be lazy and not leave the house and chill in my pjs. Sometimes I come across guys who SEEM...
Sounds like you've been with or maybe currently with an ESFJ? You hit the nail on the head here and described why I keep appreciating the INTP in my life. I can't explain it well, but it's just so...
The INTP I know would never (intentionally) hurt anyone or thing. Passive, lover not a fighter types. But, yes there are times where he hurts me emotionally, not realizing how much I do adore him...
If I can meet an ENTP interested in me IRL, i'd definitely love to know more! Seems most of them are INTx honestly, or taken by someone else lol. I will definitely keep an eye out for this type bc I...
Yeah, you are wording it well in regards to the INTP i know. In recent events, I found out this INTP loves me, so it explains his very (surprisingly) affectionate, cuddling ways with me.   I have...
It could be- I am pretty laid back/easy going. From other stories I've read on ESFJ (women) and INTP (men), it's almost horrendous stories of how demanding for attention we are, how much we don't...
Yeah, most of my male friends are INTJs to be honest, and they are like the brothers I never wanted. I love them sure, but after awhile they piss me off and I need some distance/few days away from...
I have read that article several times when I had the INTP living with me and I was helping him explore his sexual side (he was a 26 yr old virgin that I uh, deflowered -is that what the kids are...
YES! This all sounds too true for me (as of last few years).   One thing's for sure  -- If I ever came across any ISxx's, I'd be sure to sink my claws of curiosity in them!   Just glad i'm not...
I tend to gravitate towards introverts more... When I find someone extroverted, it causes ME to be the introvert and let them do their outgoing thing. Maybe I like to be (since i'm used to it) the...
Well HI friend!    Yes, I do agree with this, but I seem to try to follow their lead (I can be bit guarded too because of being burned in past). So if they're eager, I am too. Who knows though.
I have yet to meet any ISxx... :( I am always looking for various types! Thanks though!
I won't get into much details, but just curious if any other ESFJs having a hard time connecting with someone to have a meaningful relationship in their early 30s? I would think our type has the...
I hate people. (As much of a people person I am, sometimes I just don't want to deal with them, but you'd never hear me posting about hating people because no one would believe me due to how social...
I have a very positive story with an INTP. I'm definitely an ESFJ (I seriously take the test every 6 mos to see if it changes, nope -- and my friend has taken it and COMPLETE INTP so its relatable) ...
I don't think that's necessarily the case. Guess it depends on the situation.   At first, if someone is starting to be rude to me (I'm trying to be helpful, and they're being condescending or too...

INTPs are wonderful (so far...)   I have read enough about them as I'm currently kind of dating one (he's very shy and in his mid/late 20s Im his first girl encounter lets say) but so far its been...
I couldn't agree more. As I grow older (ugh I turn another year in 2 weeks too), I have found myself more upset by someone going against their word and flaking out then when I was in my early 20s. I...
I'm currently seeing an INTP and before him I believe most of my partners were INxx to some degree.   Not sure about the rest of you ESxx in here, but do you notice if someone is MORE extraverted...

Yeah I know I have no idea. I'm going to message her tomorrow and ask what's up. I haven't really done anything to deserve this. Heck, the last time I talked I told her I was sorry to hear about...
Being alone mainly. I hate being stuck in on a Saturday or friday night with nobody to talk to or nowhere to go. It's the worst feeling to get.
It gets easier. I can't help but wonder how many of them are actually trolling knowing the sort of response they're going to get. It's cool though, we'll move on and take it in our stride, right?
Thanks for easing my conscience! It's interesting actually. She was going to wait until I contacted her to talk; and I did well not talking for a month and a half which i will admit did nearly kill...
I keep finding birthday cards tucked away in random places, and instead of throwing them out the pile just grows (if i actually get given them nowadays)

Dear fellow ESFJ's,  One thing that I have always been able to relate to quite well is the list of ESFJ weaknesses over at personality page (most of them anyway). Especially Have very difficult...
I can back this up. I would much rather give indirect affection to someone than direct. I'll do most anything for someone that I love / care about; but if you ask me to speak my feelings direct and...
Everybody takes different times with relationships, and when people go out they have differing expectations on whether marriage should even occur - let alone when.  I can understand where your ESFJ...
I didn't think I was the only one, but there's always the danger of speaking on behalf of people when you don't actually know what they're thinking. Personally never hooked up randomly or anything...

Being a straight shooter can be nearly impossible for me! It's very hard to bring up the courage to be straight down the line sometimes.
I think it would be nice in future if you know that someone is going to misintepret your post, you qualify what you mean instead of waiting for a response so you can clarify. That would be effective...
Yeah though:     You're kidding me right? Because being part of a temperament means you're part of a worldwide problem? It's just getting further and further off-topic. Also, please don't imply...
I probably wouldn't object to it all that much, but it is said by the Myers Briggs foundation themselves that it is unethical. You guys are awesome too; don't worry about that. I've had heaps of fun...
I think cosmia and Hunny Bunny were pretty spot on. I agree that ESFJ's won't readily forget about someone, that rejection or hurt would probably come back. Cosmia said it well when she said that...
My apologies for being away for so long; I've been incredibly busy the last few months. Though I don't wish to bring up things that were posted a long time ago (April or further back), I think it...
I love puns, but I generally will laugh at anything. Someone I know has a very dry sense of humour and whilst it took me a while to enjoy it (as they also come off as very robotic or uncaring with...
I'd be inclined to agree. Especially if a person has been deemed by the ESFJ to be worthy or need to have special attention - then they will most definitely get it. I agree with Miss Willow, if...
ESFJ's can seem attention seeking to Introverts. They love to be told that what they did was good, and I know personally I won't feel part of a team unless I feel something positive coming back from...

I like INTP's strangely enough, even though their NP can drive me so crazy it's not funny. Actually now I think about it, their whole INTPness can drive me crazy, but nevertheless I absolutely love...
If it helps i'm ESFJ and I am exactly the same, I always like to clarify everything and make double sure I don't mess it up. I'd say I have fairly good Si and reflecting on myself throughout the year...
It's always awkward when those sorts of things happen... But there's not much you can do about it, especially if they're drunk. That magical liquor that removes everybodies inhibitions!
Then I suppose you have to differentiate between S and J, although it is not supposed to be done, let's judge another persons type. The reason we shouldn't do this is because it can be quite...
In response to someone talking about ESFJ's and INTP's. I get along great with one of my INTP friends, she's one of the nicest people you'll meet. The only things that can bother me sometimes is she...
I love ISFP's! I like how they can keep me on edge, and a good friend i know can make me feel better about anything. even by way of joke / play insulting, which nobody else has ever been able to do
I don't think there is such a huge difference, when posting in a thread why do people dislike ESFJ's, I thought that it was implying this is why you don't like ESFJ's as a whole. Correct me if I'm...
It's not because I don't want to do anything, it's more that I can't stand to leave people behind. That's one of the reasons why I hate moving more than anything else. It really pains me when I can't...
I'm not sure if i can help you but to say i'm borderline I and E too.  From the personalitypage:    For ISFJ's:

I think you're right, there isn't many of us around!  I'm not quite new anymore but I got one of my friends who's a bit down on my mind, and I'm stressed after a really long week! But other than...
When any of your friends who are depressed seem to only talk to you about it, and you give them a call and have them feeling a little bit better by the end of it.
hohum70, I'm a little unsure as to what you meant in your post, would you mind elaborating for me?  gurlygurl, don't let a thread on the internet dictate whether you have children or not.
I love swimming and I've done it for a long time now. I normally train hard for just under half the year, and sometimes I wear myself out (literally my shoulder) and I'm slowly getting it back to...
Yeah, that's true, I also seem to make other people's problems mine too and want to fix them. Which isn't the best of ideas either. But you're 100% right, every field benefits from having a range of...
I'm not sure, it used to be anybody who showed interest in me or really liked me (Terrible I know). But after being burnt I don't know, in fact I'm not sure. Someone who is generally level headed,...
Any type can be anything they want, and the profession is better as a whole having a balanced type pool, as better judgements can be made.  As an ESFJ, I would love to do psychology, but I doubt...

Eating leftover pasta and thinking about a silly conversation I had earlier on Skype with my British friend about who pronounces pasta properly.
We all need some amount of quiet time, but based on this, it looks like social interaction drains you (this does not mean you dislike hanging out with your friends). It sounds like you're an...

I reinstalled, and it installed properly. I connected for a couple of seconds, and my mic wasn't registering any sound within the program for some reason, though. :confused: I'll try to reconnect and...
Eating a poptart and waiting in vain for my hair to dry before work. Oh, you know you find this incredibly interesting... :tongue:
I can relate to most of those things on some level, but I don't think that necessarily means you're an ESFJ (it's very possible, though). The real question you need to ask yourself is this: If you...

I really really like INFP's a lot, so that would be a definite possibility for my perfect mate. Although, they would have to have a pretty high J; the strong P in some of my INFP friends drives me...

So apparently I shouldn't have nearly as good a relationship with my INFP roommate as I do. Hmm. :dry:
Watching Reba and about to fix a bowl of ice cream. :laughing:

I'm fairly certain about the NFP part of his personality (not 100%, seeing as his P seems to be fairly balanced, but the NFP descriptions do fit him a lot better than others), but the E/I is baffling...

Thanks for responding, I guess I could see some Se-you make a good case (and I'd love to hand her over to the ENFJs). I still feel everything Blanche does is entirely past-orientated- literally all...
Could I ask why you think she's written as an NFJ? (I don't see any Ni but I'm interested to know where people are seeing it-I could be persuaded that's she's ENFJ).
From the interviews I've seen I'd suggest ESFP or some Fi-Se combo but I haven't seen all of the above so ,eh, I don't know. I see Se in his hyper-in-the-moment-ness that he displays and his...

I think Four is hyper-aware of the difference between how to social obligations vary drastically from abnegation and dauntless and behaves accordingly in the novels e.g his behavior towards Tris when...

Thank you, I struggle with abstracting/summarizing what I'm going on about and this is exactly what I meant.

I agree with you, you sound like you have inferior Te that is, all the stuff about failing to be able to dismiss your emotions and consider your feelings logically. All this does seem to confirm that...
Essentially, what everyone else has said. Fe sees something established in the outer realm an obligation; Fi decides what it feels is right to do.   For example, I had a conversation with an Fi...

That's great, its nice to see that its given you some guidance (although also remember MBTI is thought-process not a box so if you end up being an engineer or something, I'm sure you'll equally excel...
All that sounds very much inferior Se and Fe to me. That is, reacting to circumstances instantly but otherwise being dis-jointed from your surroundings while still wanting to please. Particularly the...
Those descriptions seem fair but I would say inferior Se leads to ignoring the physical world or over-fixating on it (alike all inferior functions).  I've also found these that might be helpful (in...

No problem, glad to be of use. I'm just adding on to say that I'd also just caution you with the initial tests that you took (such as the above) because they don't look at functions, only the four...

Toward which professions to you tend to navigate? Ideally, I would love to work on places that could motivate other people, be helpful, and my efforts will be certainly appreciated. I don't mind...
This is actually quite difficult because of the different functions between the two personalities. ESFJs have Introverted Sensing as their Auxiliary function. This means that ESFJ's thought process...
May I know how often does she compliment on you? I think this can lead to two possibilities: either she genuinely wants you to take a smile and to motivate you (yes, we like to motivate people and...
Really annoyed today because of one person in Quora.com being so defensive and so dense with just simple questions. Everything became completely chaotic after it. I couldn't concentrate and I...
Pure_White The fastest way to lose such person is by saying in a nice way that you need some alone time. Tell him that you are probably available around x hours later. Then when the time comes, tell...
1. You enjoy creativity. 2. You are resilient with criticisms (your face says it all). 3. You are unorganized and undetermined with almost everything. 4. You never filter your words when speaking...
Happy29, I'm sorry to hear that you have to deal with your ignorant President. I hope you found out the magic that you need and everything goes smooth in the party you organized.  Laguna, thank you...
Since he is younger than you, I suppose giving him something to do that is relatively hard and takes a long time would leave him alone. After he's finished with one thing, give him a harder one and...
Stay strong Happy29!! Every country in the world is experiencing the same as well. We still don't know whether Trump is gonna fail the world just like when he was campaigning or would actually...
I have been observing myself for this kind of issue. Whenever I join something that promotes an element of competition, I always felt a sudden ambition to win no matter what. When I'm conscious, I...
Hello to my dearest ESFJs. As we all know, we, ESFJs often rant on almost everything that doesn't appear as what we think or perceive. For example, somebody violates the established rules and not...
We usually have a wide range of humor and love to laugh. Well, at least that's how I feel most of the time. If someone wants to start jokes in conversations, I would gladly listen and try to come up...
I totally agree with this. We are like the halves of each other and together, I think it is gonna be a perfect combination. But it is still quite hilarious to flashback at those times when NTs frown...
Your description of your ESFJ friend totally relates with me. That's what I would share as well during lunch time or during any kind of social interactions, hoping for some attention from the other...
No, I think she was exaggerating and overly dramatic. If I were her, I would observe your behavior first before coming into a conclusion that you are a guy that likes to flirt with other women. But...
It must be our dominant Fe thing that radiates and reflects back from our surroundings. Combined with our Sensing function, this makes clear lyrics are clear and mumbled sounds are just downright...
First, ESFJ is a very moody personality. We can go back and forth between extremely happy and extremely upset because of a very simple matter (traffic jam while we have planned for being punctual,...
Dear ISFJ,  Thank you for all of your efforts to waste your time listening to my vents when I'm upset. I have never met someone who has been as patient, warming, and understanding as you. We have...
Your life experience has created an unhealthy personality on you and that should be fixed. My suggestion: glue that kindness mask back and offer helps to everyone close to you. If they say no, just...
Blissfulwish, I know how you feel. It happened a lot to me as well but I have come to accept and try to understand the possible reasons behind of their actions. I would rather create a positive...
Lol they see us weird, we see them weird. Really can't imagine how things are not planned first. Surprises and panics usually come together and they are not pleasant for me... for us. They bring a...
Well that is pretty mysterious and are you sure that she is an ESFJ? Cause I didn't see any strong sign that she looks like one. She resembles more of an ISFP but I could be wrong. An ESFJ would...
1. Respect and Appreciation 2. Harmony and Kindness  Is that counted as four? I hope you could accept it as two cause I think those two are pretty much linked with each other.
I only gossip someone that is usually seemed weird or unusual to me. Because I have these social norms that I believe it is a common thing to see among society and if someone looks pretty off from...
I completely agree with everything that Happy29 said. We're normally the supporter for everyone and we enjoy motivating other people to become successful. It is a win-win solution, after all (just an...
Well, you ENTP bunch are just a combination of living hell. I mean, just look at those traits: - Extraverted: More energized when gathering with more people - Intuitive: Enjoys the broad view when...
Hey there. I will just write up what I usually do as an ESFJ. Please keep in mind that what I would state here may be different between ESFJs.  Mood-based activities On Normal or Positive mood,...
Well, you had no idea about her boyfriend before so it was a legit move to do. But I think she could've delivered her status better than that. It was quite ambiguous and it didn't really answer your...
1. What is your favorite food? Fried Rice!  2. What is your favorite color? Blue  3. Tell me about a pleasant memory. Hugging my mom during university graduation, telling her how much I love...
What I see here is that your friend is just trying to bring up a factual evidence (The Sensing - S plays a big role here) so that you are informed well about the real thing. It is still a harmonious...
Hey man, I know you are probably still feeling down but I just wanna say that there are still lots of similar girls like your ex-crush. Right now, you are probably under a cloud of disappointment but...
I can understand that you're upset but please bear in mind that what I just said before, may be proven different for ESFJ girls. We need a female ESFJ to explain the We don't mind go down in chats...
I think it is too fast to assume that she doesn't like you just from her attitude. I will try to bring up an opinion based on a what-if scenario, that is, if I were to be that girl.  If I were her,...
What I can say from a guy's perspective, is that I tend to close down the space gap whenever I'm with a girl that I have been really enjoying to engage with. I usually do this only after I observed...
When I think about a clubhouse, I really wish it were a huge room with comfy stuffs: - Big sofa with one seat that you can straighten your legs on - Large LED TV with a plugged hard disk full of...
Over here. How may I help you? Feel free to ask anything, I will try to answer based on my gathered information and experiences. And please, do you really have to go with those negative stereotyping?...
Yes, although you shouldn't blame yourself too much because just like you said, it was just a bad time. When everyone's not currently in a good mood, everything else goes wrong. It applies to any...
Yes, I like sharing it but I always first observe the person that I'm talking to. I will not fully share everything at first since I wanna see how they respond with a few of it and if they responded...
I like learning about new information and theories but only when they are applicable in my daily life. This doesn't mean that certain subjects like spirituality or philosophical discussions are not...
1. As an ESFJ, I tend to like win-win conditions on everything not a win-lose situation, including on an argument. To me, an argument is solved when we have come across into agreement of rational...
Been wondering why ESFJ is not much seen in a forum like this then suddenly I came up with the fact that I usually only wanna go through a source of info like this because there is a random thing in...
Same thing for me whenever I'm chatting with my crush. The funniest thing is when you check the conversation during he/she's texting, all of your chats are marked as read and you get panic all of a...'
