My aunt is an ENTJ kindergarten teacher which is kind of hilarious. She keeps those kids in line.
There was another thread that talked about this, my take away was...  NFs look for soul mates. NTs look for mind mates. SPs look for play mates. SJs look for life mates.
One of my best friend from high school is an ESTJ and we get along great. It's been my experience that ESTJ + ISFJ is usually a good relationship, I've gotten along well with every ESTJ that I've...
Surprise for everyone. : mbti  Thought I'd share that Dario Nardi will be answering questions on reddit's MBTI page on Wednesday February 13 at 1PM Pacific.  He's one of the leading researchers on...
People use cognitive functions to think and process information. Someone with all or no functions would have no strengths or weaknesses, which everybody does.
I've had this happen talking to other ISFJs, it's easy to run out of things to talk about. But not always, depends on the person.
Introverted functions are harder to identify than extroverted ones because, well, they're introverted. I think it's usually a lot easier to spot Fe, Ne, Te or Se because it's out there and in your...
Strengths and weaknesses, a million times strengths and weaknesses.  Being an Si user means I need structure in my life and I do best when I have a plan laid out and expectations set, and I need...
There is no one perfect match, personality type is just one of many things that make up who someone is.
Life mates.
She can't pretend to be happy, cheerful, or interested when she's not.
Nah, we're too similar.
Intelligence is really important to me. If I can't have an intelligent conversation with a guy I'm dating it's not gonna work out. It's not the only factor but it's a big one.
Sensor does not equal low intelligence. Come onnnn.
ESFJs can be great friends. Studying the ESFJ profile and Fe + Si may help you understand them better. But remember, there is more to a person beyond their four letters.
I got ISFJ when I took the official test in high school and the description fit me to a tee. I've taken online tests with varied results.
Dammit I thought this was Morgan Freeman.
I'd say ENFJ as well.
I think high school is a good time to take the test. Kids younger than that may have the functions well-developed but maybe can't necessarily answer questions about it.
I like being around outgoing people, they can liven up the conversation and make things more interesting.
You don't have to dispel MBTI. It's a good tool for better understanding yourself and how to communicate with others. It should not be used as a way to put limits on others or yourself, human...
Dario Nardi has done some research about the neuroscience behind cognitive functions. Here's a talk he gave at google:  
All of them.
This is really interesting. There's been a little research into MBTI and the cognitive functions (especially Dario Nardi) but much of MBTI is still speculation and repeating things read on blogs and...

If you kept googling you'd find socionics which says INFJ is your dual.
It's a balance thing. The idea is that two extroverts together will never give themselves space for introspection and two introverts together will never want to leave the house.  Results may vary.
Admitting it is the first step. :p
I'd think this could be an intuitive mantra as well.  Some sensors can be overly-literal and just accept a statement with the assumption that someone is serious about their words and their plans,...

Hi, Earworms! It's nice to find another person who has the same combination of personality types (even though they're switched in this case). This is the first time I have seen that thread, so I will...
Thanks for posting this thread! I'm an ISFJ and my current boyfriend is an ISTP so I'm trying to understand him better. Personality and bonding are important to him.
Hi! Welcome to PersonalityCafe! :happy:
Welcome to the forums! Hope you enjoy your time here. :proud:
BehindSmile - I can completely relate to the 30-second rush of love you've described. The difference is that I don't say it out loud and simply enjoy the moment.  In my romantic relationship, I...
My mom took the MBTI years ago. I think she was an ENFP. She's an ambitious, friendly, enthusiastic person and constantly encourages me to be more bold and try new things. She is thick-skinned while...
Great thread!  1. How do ISFJ's view love? Well, I firmly believe two people can have a strong, healthy, happy relationship. My parents' marriage is a great example. My mom and dad are truly...
Hello! Welcome to the forum! Hope you enjoy your time here.
Welcome to Personality Cafe! Hope you enjoy your time here. That's neat that you live in Sweden - I've been interested in the country for a while.
Welcome to Personality Cafe. :) Hope you have a great time here!  (And in response to your first post, that's happened to me more than once.)

I'm in a great relationship and I'm happy about it. :)
I'm like that, too.
I over-think all the time. My confidence level varies...I'm working on believing in myself more.
Let's see how this stacks up:  follows the rules [most of the time], polite [most of the time], fears drawing attention to self [depends on the situation], dislikes competition [I like some...
My nephew and I saw this movie and we both enjoyed it. The book is different in several ways (I'll have to ask my nephew what they are).
Hi, everyone, how are you? *waves* I enjoy learning about personality types, and found this forum a couple of days ago. After taking a plethora of personality tests over the years, I found out that I...'

I actually really like parties. (And when I say parties I'm really only referring to family gatherings. Not that I wouldn't like to go to regular parties, I just don't have a ton of friends and...
I'm pretty certain that my mom is ISTJ. And I'm guessing my dad might be an INTP (I'm not very confident in that typing though.).
I'm a female INFJ.  My results:  You scored 26.667 out of 100 masculine points, 67.5 out of 100 feminine points, and 70 out of 100 androgynous (neutral) points.
It's okay. I've read more about cognitive functions and I'm 99% sure that I'm Fe now. I actually meant to close this thread, since I'm pretty certain that I'm INFJ now. But thanks anyway. :)
I'm far from organized, I've never been on time a day in my life, and I procrastinate everything. All of my perfectionism goes into oddball things. Like my looks, for example. I spend waaayy too...
Alright, will do.  Here's the thread:
A while back, I posted a thread hoping to find some insight onto what my MBTI type might be, and I guess the information I provided didn't give the clearest idea because after studying into cognitive...
I'm special.. :sadcloud:
Now they're just asking for it: .  We need to strike soon.
you feel guilty for not totally fitting your stereotypes.
There are INFJ foods? .-. I thought these things only applied to people. xD
Well, for one, I'm extremely sensitive to other peoples' opinions. A lot of times, I actually find myself avoiding people in order to keep from anything that could possibly have a negative impact on...
A self deprecating INFJ? Wow, really original.
Omg, I love dressing up for Halloween! I do it every year! ^u^ I honestly think I'm the only girl my age that dresses up because she honestly likes it, rather than as an excuse to look sexy or...
INTPs are more like robots than humans.. Couldn't you try being compassionate for once?
haha, yeah. I'm in too!
One warning label wouldn't be enough.
I can fucking vouch for that. :rolleyes:
Heh, I'm still trying to decide if I'm an INFP or an ENFP, but tbh I don't think I'd rather be any other type. Imo, the NFPs are the most interesting (although this opinion may be biased). I can see...
lol, I swear it changes by the week. Rn it's magenta. ^u^
I was told to smile abnormally often as a teen. Sometimes even by random strangers in public. I haven't so much in the last couple of years though, so maybe I'm happier now? Idk.
I usually think about how quickly the year went by and whether or not I lived it to it's fullest. This year was especially hard because I turned 20, and I feel like I spent too much of my teen years...

So.. 8 pm, London time would be like... 3 pm here.. Yeah, I think I can do it.  So this may be a dumb question, but how do I join? Where are we gonna do it at?
I might be up for it as long as I'm free. I don't like video or audio chatting though.    And tbh that sounds kind of fun, but I'm afraid I'm too awkward to even feel comfortable PM'ing someone...
I have a horrible temper. Even though I hate admitting it, even the smallest irritation can get me boiling.

Well, I do like the company of other people. I just prefer to talk to them as little as I can. Like, I enjoy sitting in a group, but I prefer to just listen and let others do most of the talking....
ENTPs could do just about anything they set their minds to. It's a shame they're too lazy to do anything about it.
ESFP, even if you don't drink, you're the classic insensitive asshole.

I like to write, and I find the cemetery down the street from my house a very peaceful quiet place to do it.

I just want to let y'all know that, according to sources, it's gonna be really, really hot tomorrow (Friday 20th).
Do tell!
Yes, I am goofy. And awkward.  And I also love trolling.
Yes, ISFJs do want others to be happy!!!  Sorry, had nothing significant to add there - just wanted to affirm.
Well, you're an ISFP so.....................  perhaps you belong over there. On the ISFP forum.  It's a start ?  :)
I'm not an INTP (I'm a female ISFJ) but I also have some trouble making / keeping friends.
Yeah. They can be pretty scary, but so cool too.
Oooh, interesting, why the INTJ thread?  (I have two family members who are INTJs, hence my interest :).

Good point!

Oh I wasn't being sarcastic; was just genuinely curious. lol.  What would I do for love? Well, hopefully many good deeds :)

On behalf of myself, I know nothing about music theory. Had some violin lessons when I was little, but that's about it.

Yes, Elizabeth Taylor's White Diamonds is the BEST! (for women, that is). I like her Black Pearls too.  Cologne on men?  Sure, why not! :)

I'm sorry, I'm not a professional music composer.
Ah! Well, you know all about it then!
No, I haven't tried blergh blerghing. Only blahing. Do you think blerghing could work???
I didn't take no test, but I'm pretty sure I have a low IQ.   Someone said that ISFJs have no objective logic (or somefin like dat), and I think I'll just believe it.   University is getting too...

That's so gay I'm sorry (For things that aren't my fault) Man up or any equivalent (be a man, nut up, etc) Everything happens for a reason Any kind of sweeping generalization.
Going to have to disagree. The Stand and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows are, in my opinion, both great examples of good books with bad endings.
Not really sure I know how to answer that question. I obviously have nothing to compare it to, it's just who I am.   I suppose a lot of the traits of ISFJ might be seen as typically feminine, but...

My favorite movie would probably be either Goodfellas or Reservoir Dogs, though I'm not at all a violent person. :tongue:

Not really my style (I especially loathe dubstep), but I'll support anything that takes attention off Lady Gaga.
In my opinion symbiotic powers are more interesting, and gives way to more plot development later on in the story. A perfect example would be Venom from the Spider-Man universe.

May not reflect on any certain type.   I find myself to be very much a creature of habit. I am really bothered if plans are changed, or (even worse) things happen completely unexpectedly.
I've never been in a physical confrontation. I'd have to be all kinds of pissed off to want to fight somebody.
