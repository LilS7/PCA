Props to all of ya'll! I'm 34 and won't have my Bachelor's for another 2 years. Growing up dirt poor it took me awhile to finish college, but I'm working on it!!
Welcome to the club, I joined for the exact same reason , and it has definitely helped!
Welcome!!! You've got quite a diverse amount of things you like. That's awesome you can play the piano, I couldn't carry a tune in a bag!!
I have a hard time with that kind of stuff, usually I just migrate to doing something else productive and then get back on the main project I was working on.

Yes, I usually say I don't care when someone asks me something like that, especially when I don't want to be part of anyone else's arguments that have nothing to do with me.
Nobody is ordinary!! :rolling: Welcome to the site!
They went that way, lol 
I don't really care how other people perceive me, I know what all I've done and who I am, so that's all that matters to me!
I wouldn't say I'm flaky, I just have about a million things to do and sometimes some of them take priority over others.
I know I'm super slow time-wise with relationships, it takes me forever to build one up.
Same here, I just did my work, mostly was either by myself or hung out with a few close friends, but that was about it.
Hello everyone, I'm 34 years old, I live in the U.S. I live on my own, have a 6 year old boy, work too much, and trying to finish up college.

I thought about going when I went through a nasty divorce, plus we had a son. Life was pretty miserable then, but instead I focused on myself and worked through everything on my own and never went!

I have excellent procedural and semantic memory, but poor episodic memory. Of course, I am not an INTP, so my input here is irrelevant.

Congratulations, and welcome! How long until you find out that you are a different type again?
Came in here because I was curious to see how quickly Haddaway had been mentioned; first sentence. I was not disappointed.
That remark about her dead dog would've scored points with an ISTP. I mean, I chuckled.
1. Lol helmets...that was a good joke. 2. No, we've never been that excited.  Ah, oh well. Usually I'm the first to notice time stamps. Not today, I guess.
Be happy, never satisfied.
Apologies, OP, but your calculations are incorrect.  The glass is actually completely full; the water is merely in different states.

+1 for pajamas all day! Unless I plan on leaving the house, those warm, maroon colored pants with odd looking dogs on them stay on always.
I'm a big fan of knives
My mom needs to hear it, so I say it to her. Even then, she always asks why I say it so sarcastically. In general, I never say it, nor do I usually give people compliments, especially on their...

Seriously, because we all know JamieBond grows a great one...
Anyone here ever try hiking trail maintenance? It involves a lot of backpacking around national parks with a saw...
Right now I'm trying to plan to at least hit the Rockies this summer.
Backpacking.
Is accepting the risk of possible death by starvation, falling off a cliff or animal attack, while hiking alone considered weird?
And that's where I go wrong. I never ever ask anyone their name. If it comes up, i.e. they ask, I'll respond, but other than that, I just don't get names. Makes things kind of funky.  Really?...
I know exactly what you're saying. Conventional lifestyle sucks. Vagabonding sounds like a hell of a lot fun. As it is, I'm trying to get into backpacking, so I can head out west for the summer.
Why does it look like someone took a bite out of the screen on the right?
most of my communication with others is through sarcasm. It makes things more interesting. It's just like DustyDrill said, with a half smile and an obvious tone of voice. The only issue is when...
I agree. Besides, it's way more fun that way.
First thought arises the moment of first cognition. As such, the slate is muddled in its creation. It is never truly blank, but this makes no difference as it is not one's origins, but one's...
Same here. I instigate when I'm bored. Otherwise, there's no reason to get involved.
I'm the instigator. I get to be the evil inclination who looks like the devil, floating just above your shoulder.
I think I feel like crap now because all of my projects are dead... Must...Move...Out... -.-
Not a chance. The Samsung one with Justin Hawkins from The Darkness was the best of the night. At number 2, is the Seinfeld Accura one.
I've thought about this many times. I still kind of want to do it. Maybe when I get my own place...
A penguin caught a fish in antarctica and then it was eaten by a polar bear. Satisfied from his delicious meal, the bear went to sleep.
Yeah, no ISTP wants to read an emotional wall of text about god in order to better his or her state of mind.
Sorry, but this makes me want to punch you very hard.  As for myself, I've been in bad shape mentally for quite some time now. I lost the drive to make great things that I once had, dropping all of...

I don't react to it.  People can think whatever they want.
This is what happens when the top threads in the forum for the last month are all about feelings and relationships.  It makes people insane.
1. I am married (second time), and I have 3+1 kids. 2. Whatever works is right. 3. Whenever it happens.   4. Single dad is tough.  Can be fun, but a lot of things fall by the wayside when you work...
That's a strange thing to say.
I have two tattoos.
I've seen my parents maybe 6 times in the last 18 years.  I call on birthdays or holidays if I remember, but it's not on the top of my head to do so.  Same with siblings, only much less.
Thank you for taking the Creativity Test. The results show your brain dominance as being:  Left Brain     Right Brain 30%     70%  You are more right-brained than left-brained. The right side of...
Unless someone blindly trusts another 100% they have trust issues?    In my experience, anyone who is incredibly defensive about trust has an issue.
Do you still feel the same way?  If so, my previous comment stands.
I don't have any friends...
Leonidas may have made his decision emotionally, but it can still be logical to hold off the enemy for a few days.
Sounds logical to me.  Do what you can with what you have.
Trust issues.  I so hate that term.    With so little to go on from your story, I'd say you should stay away from any relationship with an intelligent person until you're able to better deal with...
This is me also.
Very much this.
This exactly.
I think that when I show an emotion, it's rather detached from the emotion itself.  It's like I just put on a mask that I think represents the emotion, but they're not really connected.  It's a...
If you think it's hard to raise an ISTP child, try being an ISTP parent in this society!  EDIT:  Even worse is being a widowed ISTP parent in this society...
Ha.  Way cool!
Re-read that...
That would so rock.
The functions give me a headache...  I need a dumbed down version of the explanations with concrete examples.
I can't type people to save my life.  I either like someone or I don't, and don't really go much deeper than that.  I'm almost positive though that my future wife is a XXXP with J tendencies.  :)
Weird.  Why would you ask for bread after they brought it out?  Girls, stop asking if you look good then!!!  You always do, do you want a ranking every time you ask?
Do people really know what they're going to do in any given random, hypothetical situation?
Animals seem to really like me.  I don't mind them, unless they're overly needy.  Cats are awesome.
I treat people differently based on whether it's a friend, a fling, or a relationship.  A relationship is the only instance where I can see that when I wake up tomorrow, chances are I'll want to be...
I will be this year, but not tandem.    There's a database of fatalities out there related to skydiving.  Doesn't appear to matter how many jumps one has, you still might die.
Why do you want to feel like part of a group?
Why bother?  Do you NEED so many people in your life that you have to give every questionable (or worse) person so many chances to change your opinion of them?
I don't really get it though.  A long term relationship is a relationship that has lasted a long term...  I'm not sure what there is to like or not like about it...
What does this mean exactly?
Because they do!
Not really trying stuff.  More related to the second, but indirectly.  Being concerned about what I might think about what they did about this or that, or what they are capable of in whatever area.
Most of this stuff I agree with.  However, the relationships I've had have never started out as friendships.  Most likely for all the reasons that you guys keep saying that are trouble in...
Ya, this one too.
I think the biggest issue in my relationships is that people seem to think there's a bunch of expectations, and feel like they need to meet or exceed those expectations.  I have no idea where they...
I can still be right without having to argue and whatnot.  I'm fine with knowing I'm right.  Don't have to broadcast it, or get anyone else's approval for it.
I wouldn't know.  I've never been wrong...
Probably.  I couldn't finish reading the rest of your post with all that blathering.
I have a lot of weird quirks. The one that bothers me though, is my inability to refer to people by name when talking to them.
Disappearing without a trace, never to be found again.
I don't think I trust people at all.  Not in the usual sense.  I guess I have more of a sliding scale of belief and acceptance.  I accept that no one is truly trustworthy, but there are some people...
I absolutely abuse Amazon Prime.

I do all this stuff with my kids and my soon to be wife!!
Walks, bike rides, kayaking, playing at the park, or at the beach, frisbee, tossing whatever ball around, hula hooping, as soon as I get the garage organized a bit, I'll start working out again.
I went to school because I didn't know what else to do.  Now, if I go to school, it's because there is something specific I want to learn about.  I don't worry about whether I'll learn about it...'
'To me, to be sensitive is to be human.  I have a ton of soft spots.  The main thing is that I normally keep all this to myself for one reason or another...primarily since I don't want my emotions...
Same here.  I can be quite loud and talkative and borderline obnoxious in certain situations.  But I'm definitely quiet and reserved and alone more often than not.
Remember playing this a ton in junior high.  At least I wasn't the kid who actually broke his hand as a result of administering the beatdown!
It stops being fun. Something else becomes more fun. I get this horrible feeling that I'm losing touch with everything around me. I wake up out of my own little world and start again from square...
ISTP INTP ESTP ESTJ  The others (aside from ISTP) are states of mind I commonly morph into for small stretches.
Here's mine. 
Cooking is cool...it's just all the dirty dishes afterwards that I absolutely LOATHE cleaning up.  If nothing else, cooking (much like gardening) is a great topic for conversation to break the ice...
You're right most people are pretty f'ing boring.  Why is this?
I feel exactly the same way sometimes as far as killing threads.  Much of the time, my postings are so serious and heavy and authoritative that it screams the final authority has spoken.  no further...
As far as I can tell, I have a number of ISTJ's all around me in family and friends.  We all get along really well together, as they are generally agreeable and able to go along with whatever ideas I...
From everything I've read so far, I have to agree with madhatter that you sound more like an ISTP as well.  From experience, I definitely have my share of extraverted moments.  And sometimes these...
I planned a week-long roadtrip alone a few years ago to a very desolate but beautiful region.  I made it 2 days before I got bored out of my mind and decided to drive back home and relax for the rest...
Yeah this sounds like me for the most part.  I don't like being late, but I don't like being early either.  Perhaps just in time would be the best way to describe it.  There are many times which...
Hmmm...I think I have a so-called panic button, but it operates a little differently than for most people.  Instead of becoming hysterical and irrational, when the button is pushed I become more...

Sure, I like making people happy...and most of the time I can do so by doing something for them that they value (for example, fixing their computer or setting up their television) and I try to stick...
When I see an opportunity with positive EV (expected value), I POUNCE on it and not let it get away.  If I was smart, I would have began 'research mode' before said decision, as well as during and...
I find in sports (and probably everything else), practice and repetition greatly reduce dependence on Ti.  Everything becomes second nature and it's no longer necessary to play out scenarios in your...
Exactly.  I'll often use my Ti to put myself in someone else's shoes and play out a scenario in my head.  Maybe not the same as true empathy but faking it isn't very hard.  I've read where ESTP's...
In other words, it sounds like what you're saying is you don't sweat about the small stuff.  As you mentioned, showing emotion is something that can be learned over time, regardless of type with...

'Smart' people are often labeled as 'N's maybe?  I remember reading some statistic where N's were overrepresented in certain academic categories.
As an ISTP, when I have my moments, I always have people questioning what I've had to drink.

I'd say I'm extremely laid back most of the time.  The thing about me (and many other ISTP's assumedly) is that there are going to be times where I am very intensely focused on an idea or activity. ...
All in all I think IT is a very general term which can have a very broad range of duties.  For example, those working a call center or monitor servers all day would be considered more white...
I'm trying to figure out what it means to have an inferior Fe function?  Can anyone provide some possible examples?  I know a lot of it has to do with the inability to express emotion or respond to...
From my experiences, I work very well with ESTJ's most of the time.  As Alvarez mentioned, we complement each other very well in many ways.  While I'm laid back and empowering, the ESTJ is a great...
Other ISTP's - if we have the same interests, no one else can match our level of intensity ISTJ - willing to do some of the 'dirty work' I despise ESTJ - my 'enforcers' - as long as we're both on...
As with the other ISTP's, pretty much dead on for me too.  Having festivities at my house, or somewhere I am very familiar with helps a lot too.
I usually try to be very polite and helpful.  I guess working in a public service environment forever does that to you.  Generally speaking, if the other person is not personable and not judgmental...

First person that comes to mind would be George Carlin.  My mind seems to work the same way his does and after reading his autobiography I really wonder if he was also an ISTP.  Also on the list:...
I personally don't go too crazy over them...my ISTP bro definitely does.  The difference is likely that our interests differ (sports, computers, music for me) and I just never really had much...
For starters, I tend to zone out into my own little dream world.  I'll start talking to myself a ton (more than usual) and just overthink everything.  But sometimes this isn't necessarily a bad...

I've always been a dog person myself.  My 2 are like my kids.  Now I enjoy certain breeds (agile, athletic) more than others (toy, fat, gigantic) but I still prefer them over cats.
I can think of a lot of things, but the one that sticks in my mind right now is the ability to enjoy the work I do.
Manuals are for babies.  But if I'm putting something together for someone else, and don't want to mess something up royally and end up camping out at their house for the next 3 days, I'm going to...
I wonder if ISTP's have the natural ability to morph into other types moreso than others.  Perhaps it is our natural inclination to be resourceful and adapt appropriately to the current conditions....'
