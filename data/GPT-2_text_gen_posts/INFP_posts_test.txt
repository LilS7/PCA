Yeah I don't mind!
Yeah for me early-mid 08' is the end of the core 00's, late 08' was the transition from core 00's to electropop culture, and mid 09 onwards was purely electropop (aka early 10's culture).
This is pretty accurate. I would also have an additional age group called the 'Youth' period. Basically the cultural zeitgeist of an individual is usually formed during this period and this is...
Yeah this is VERY good! Although for me I always viewed 1993 borns as the last 100% Pure Y year, with those born in early-mid 94' being the last Pure Ys altogether. Similarly, I tend to start pure Z...

I think what you meant to ask if those born from 1994-1999 aren't 90's KIDS, and the simple answer to that is because they didn't spend most of their childhood in the 90's. Those born in 1994-1996...

Yeah I agree I loved being an Early-Mid 2000's Kid! But I also liked being a teen in the Late 00's/Early 10's, at least when it came to the music and pop culture.
We got in 2000/2001, didn't start using it regularly till 2005.
Minus being born in the weird grey area between Gen Y & Gen Z, I like being my age! Although I wouldn't have mind being born in the mid 70's, Gen Xers are way cooler :wink:
Yeah and us Mid 90's babies are literally in between both worlds lol!
I've drank alcohol a few times at family events and parties, but personally no I don't see myself ever regularly drinking if that's what you mean.
Your 'teen' years are when you are between ages 13-19, so wherever you spent most of that time in is the decade or cultural era you belong to. Mathematically speaking, age 16 is in the middle of...

The fact there are kids born in 2000 & 2001 in high school right now is freaky enough, let alone no 90's babies at all in high school lol.
Yeah I used to think 93ers and 94ers were cups but now that I think about it makes more sense for them to be the last of Core Y, then the start of Late Y. I think the reason why I seemed to included...
I 100% Agree!
Yes it would be massively different if I were to claim watching a show like the Flintstones since that show was before my time. However, I actually did grow up watching these two shows amongst other...
And I grew up watching both of these shows, both new episodes and reruns, so I'm definitely a Millennial in that regard! (Ok maybe that's wishful thinking, but I deserve some cred lol)
This begs the question do you think coming of age in the Obama or Bush 43' administration is a major Millennial Characteristic?  For instance let's use age 18 as an example of coming of age, then...
Yeah pretty much, I liked Catscratch & Avatar, but the other ones I was never too fond of. Plus the shows are 10 years old, but they still seem very recent in the grand scheme of things
Definitely the new one! It's more accurate to start Gen Y in the early 80's than the late 70's
I think the notion with Nickelodeon is that the earlier 2000's, 2000-2004, was mainly targeted at Core Y (SNICK/TeeNick) and Late Y (Nicktoons). The later 2000's, 2005-2009 was mainly targeted at...

Yeah my Mom was born in 1957 and My Biological Dad in 1949. However most of my good friends have parents born in the Late 50's/Early-Mid 60's, heck my step dad was born in 1961!
Yeah this is true. As early as the 1980's, was when it was common for people to put off marriage and child bearing to late 20's or 30's. Hence why for 80's babies their parents would be core boomers...
I agree 100%
Yeah they graduated in 1998, which I agree with is mostly Y, but you can't just forget about their Freshman-Junior Years of High School.  Freshman Year: 1994-1995 (Firmly X)  Sophomore Year:...
But how though? Both 1995 & 1996 are Solid X Culture Years, plus 2000 & 2001 are both Solid Y Culture Years. The only one's that more complicated are 1997 & 1998, as both years are cuspy, 1997 seems...
True but by that definition a 79er could be considered Y as well since their coming of age years were 1995, 1997, & 2000. However I do get where your coming from. I believe that someone's youth is...
1980 still seems pretty X IMO. They were kids in the 80's, some of the last to have physical memories of the Challenger Explosion, Regan's Presidency, & the Cold War. Also they were in High School...
Those born in the 80's typically have parents born in the late 40's & 50's, so they would be full blown baby boomer kids. While those born in the 90's typically have parents born in the late 50's &...

True this is probably the most accurate way of dividing it. For our cohort born in the mid 90's we are on the borderline when it comes to practically everything. However, I would say I'm a Late Y at...

I'll use myself as an example using school years:  Blue=First Half of Childhood  Red=Second Half of Childhood   Green=Peak of Childhood

True. I never thought if it like that. Maybe I should just straight out ask. I will try again.
I haven't done it yet. It's been hard. Every time I want to ask, he seems busy, and the first thing you say to someone can't be, hey, wanna hang out sometime?. I'd have to make small talk, which he...

@Seralya, that's a very good point. I was also thinking of doing something simple and low key like dessert since we don't know each other too well yet, and I don't want to make it a big deal.  ...
That's a good suggestion. I don't really bowling though.
Will do!
Thanks for the encouragment,  cursive! Dessert sounds like a good idea. Maybe I'll ask him to grab ice cream.

Ok, So I understand what I want, and how I feel about liking men. That's all good. But the problem now Is how do I tell my parents?  I want to tell them, but I really don't know how to say to them...
I'm Contempt, as always I suppose, I have spent this afternoon buried in my book and In my own world, only after spending this morning out with our animals. Suppose It's a good mix :) . I will have...
Whats the hardest thing I'm going to face in life? . . I haven't got a clue. But from my current perspective, telling my parents I'm gay seems like a huge hurdle. I do suspect that it will seem...
I do! MI6 too, and Torchwood.  ...oh that's fictional. oh well, still :)
I just got the book two days ago and have just read it. I thought it was brilliant!
This is true for me too. My family love me, and i them, but they never wanted to deeply understand who I am. I am contempt with this and just keeping the deeper me to my self. different people see...
To look at, and understand yourself. knowing yourself is important; and there is so much to know!  also be happy - I have not let anything get me down lately, and I feel better for it -either that...
I guess not, but I wasn't watching Comedy Central
This is such an incredible song <3
Thanks for your reply, and I can relate, in part at least, to you.
This is not as big a deal as I may have made it to be, but the reply to pointing it out Well just do it more or something along those lines.
I feel the same, although I have only ever 'entered' this state of mind in a time of 'need' or 'emotion' not just for the sake of it. sometimes I think I'm too young, other times I just live my life...
I Find that my parents are never happy with any effort I give them with anything. I will say I used to be quite lazy but lately I have tried to do by best and do everything they ask without hassle...
Hey there! 43579
Those spoiler buttons still pre-load the images so it doesn't matter
I'm not the best driver, and I currently hold only a restricted licence, but I drive as safely as I can, and (don't tell my parents) only speed on an open road with no one around.
Don't let someone tell you your beliefs are wrong, they are yours. What you think is right and true. People may not agree with you, that does not make your beliefs wrong it just means they are...
Midnight Blue, no question.  I can be so many things and I feel I'm very contrasting.  You may see a dark shade of blue where, in fact, there is a story behind every line of that magnificent...
I'm fine with ads. I make websites so know how sometimes you need them. Just a reccomendation though, make them open in a new window when clicked ('target=_top')
Yes I want people to Understand. Some people anyway. But I think it doesn't matter if they could understand me, because so many people don't care to. Not really and fully.
Just interested to know what some other INFJs' ideas are on letting people in to our lives, or keeping a distance. Personaly there are very few people I let in to my world at all, and I let no one...
I wouldn't be bothered personally. Actually I sometimes actually think that I don't realize how obvious I can be or how others might feel.
If I don't see good in someone, I won't hang around. If it happens to be you chances are you won't notice me by accident. I can be good at just disappearing If I don't want to see you
In a library or out on a walk somewhere remote alone
I agree, and although i'm a very black and white person (on the outside anyway), this website needs some colour. It is too bright and the black doesn't help at all.
I'm defiantly a night person, no doubt about it. I enjoy being out late and sleeping half the day away.
When you say you have lost your balance I knew exactly how you feel, I can say I'm in a similar place right now and have lost the thing that really keeps me going (my balance) and my world i spinning...
Looks good! I think the top navigation bar/news would look better with a darker colour, white seems to bright.
I Would Be With The Tenth, all the way.  ... Actually Both of them ;) - and Capt. Jack
I was going to say that (About Doctor Who), but I thought my second thing seemed more appropriate.     But apart from the TARDIS, I would get in my car and just drive, stopping only to enjoy a...
Thanks @Solitude315. Your right and I do like constructive criticism because you have something to work on and improve, i guess it just upset me a little.
How do you feel when people criticize your work or something you do?  Whenever someone tells me that something I have done is not good enough it makes me feel like I am not good enough.   Maybe...
YES -  Owner of a Lonely Heart 
As a Doctor Who fan I have to say Repeated memory wipes by the Silence will eventually fry your brain - The Eleventh Doctor But I'm the same, and when I do remember it's after a while and people...
Currently I am reading 'The White Wolf's Son', a good read. Not quite what I expected when I picked it up but I will finish it soon. and next I want to read 'The Wolf Gift'...
Tonight I sit outside my window in the blackness of night, staring out into the wilderness we call space. Peace. Beauty. I could stay here till the morning light. The thousands of suns I stare upon...
I was going to close my facebook a few months back, but as well as wanting to be able to message my family in ausse and school friends i found that i had connected a few other websites to it...
30 Seconds to Mars - All of my collections. It seems to be fitting my mood right now.
I have seen it, and i agree. I did actually think that the first time I watched the movie, and from the beginning (or when they got their powers) I kinda thought Andrew would never work right with...
Ok so i have just watched Underworld 4 (Awakening) and must say it was a really good film, Compared to the other films out in the last few months anyway. I don't think it was as good as the first 3...
I would never want to turn off my emotions. sometimes I hide them from the world, but I still need them for me.'
