Thank you for the response. I have heard of that theory, and I probably will not check out those links for I am lazy, but if comets did really carry water, then where did those comets come from?...
I feel you
Intp's write better scientific novels.
Thank you all for the responses and that picture was funny. The articles seem helpful, and I will read them as soon as I'm done being lazy.
What are the differences?
I thought I intj's are the only ones who would respond  this way. I thought I was safe in these intp's forums.
yeah this isn't deep thing. just an empirical model observation. google.[/QUOTE] Thanks for bursting my bubble.

I don't know many intj's but from what I've heard, they might be so blunt, they probably hurt every other personality type that isn't an ntj.
I don't know if ntp's are neurotic or not, but if they are, then compared to the ntp's, then I guess ntj's are more chill. I agree with tj's being aggressive beca use they have to deal with stupid...

I'm going to change a nickname, the mastermind, the scientist, or the strategist.
Who would win in a battle of the introverts, in an arguement? The mastermind, the scientist, or the stubborn logical istj. Haha I'm kidding the logical istj.
I'm kidding
Just ignore them and go meet one of us istjs were better then them haha.
Let's start another argument since I do not know how to add to the above posts. Would would win in an arguement between an istj, estj, intj, entj, intp and entp?
To be honest these results are interesting, I thought infp would score as scholars/ artisians, or possibly even servers, but not a king nor a warrior. But thank you for taking the time to take the...
Thank you for the response aND a lot, if not all stp's tend to be warriors from my observation.
Thank you for taking the test and I have noticed that a lot of np's are artisians.
Thank you fo taking the test and I am seeing a pattern, I believe ntj's are mostly kings, np's are artisans ntp's are artisan scholars and stp's warriors. I'm still waiting for the rest of the...

Haha I'm still waiting  for a response and I'm only asking these questions  because of observations that I've made.
How come intj's and entj's are assholes? Are most psychopaths intj's and Entj's?

Yes believe it or not I've been analyzing this theory for about 6 months, that's how interesting this theory is for me

*ZC dons judge wig*  ORDER, ORDER, ORDER in the gym.  The prosecutor, me, the judge myself, and the defendant I, begin the proceedings.  Judge ZC:  Judge, hand me the evidence.  *The Bailiff...
There is a difference between evolving and devolving.  [Edit]  Narrator = Extrovert The Dude = Introvert  
Funny you mention IQ.  I was thinking that a person's intelligence can be seen on their face, and many use that as well as other factors about body language, speech style, whatever, to rank someone...
So what happens when you use your Ti to press.... ALL OF THEIR BUTTONS?!  Only one way to find out.
I already tried that bit.  And it worked for awhile.  Now... people don't care.  It's like...  'durrrr, let's durrr, and durrr, and durrr.'  Maybe because summer is coming to a close xD  [Edit] I...
'Assuming I had a hand in it, I always at least consider the possibility of my own culpability. I like to think that I'm honest enough to admit it, when it's really my fault. But more often than not,...
Speed Racer was cool, but I think that Johnny Quest was the coolest! Get Smart and I Dream of Jeannie were a couple of faves. I always wanted my own genie, like Barabra Eden.
Being a Sensor is a double edged sword. Everything gets magnified. When inconsistencies detract from the story or style of a film it's a drag.  But, as long as there's more to enjoy on the whole,...
I can totally relate. I have high expectations for myself and it really sucks not meeting them. Unfortunately, I get more angry with myself than with other people. It seems easier to give others the...
I think I'm pretty easy to read. However, I'm not the cheery, life of the party kind of guy, and I get a lot of comments like what's wrong? or are you OK? when I'm thinking or trying to focus on...
As a kid I dreamed of being like Robinson Crusoe, living in the wild. I think I would miss my laptop and my MP3 player now.  Hasta la revolucion ;)  Zen Bear the reluctant capitalist lackey
The world would be better off, if more people followed your ecological ways. However, you need to change your avatar. The space craft clashes with your Anarcho-primitivism message. The space shuttle...
Amen, brother!  It really is the only way to move on! It's funny that it's such a hard thing to do sometimes, though. Social faux pas are a breeze for me to overcome, but some early career mistakes...
Mercer:  What the others have said is right, own your mistakes, but don't dwell on the negative stuff. Remember you are an  isTj not an isFj. Think about it, are you better off getting emotionally...
CordiINTJ:  What's a unithest?  And yes, you do sound a little depressed, but that's not surprising since your Dad sounds like a jerk!
HelloKittyKat:  I think Niss and Darkest have spelled it out for you. Your situation doesn't seem to hold a lot of promise. For whatever reason this guy doesn't seem to want to give you anything...
Hey Functianalyst:  I see what you mean about the type fad. I don't see much of that. I'm new and have spent almost of my time with my follow ISTJs, most of whom don't seem that way to me. ...
[/LIST]  if you assume that type is not genetic, the only thing that follows is that it is a factor of your environment. It's also obvious that we cannot readily change our type. Sorry, I don't...
Yes, I agree. Our feelings are what motivate us, to do what we do.
Oh yes, I've been there. The drive for perfection, can have it's downside.
Interesting. I'm not alone. I'd like to go with the flow a little myself. And, no one has ever called me boring to my face, but I've certainly gotten that sense from some people. It used to bug a...
No I don't speak French, but I studied it in high school, and I have some relatives and friends who live in Quebec, so I get exposed to it every once in a while. Whether what he said in french was...
Johnny: thanks for the video. Very funny. What's strange is that I can only understand French spoken by an English transvestite:confused:
Thanks Dude. I've had a lot of positive feedback on the avatar. I love it when people get it! Your dog seems pretty adorable and bear-like too.  And always happy when someone appreciates my humor...
Wulfdot:  Sorry I missed your input last night, there seemed to be a deluge of responses while I was replying to some of the previous posts. Two things struck me about your posts.   Firstly, your...
Yes, I've always thought so. It's true value lies in the time we spend in self evaluation and discovery. It's not a perfect label of who we are.     I get the should part, as in a Duty we...
That was me in my teens and twenties. Nothing like a moon lit stroll through the deserted streets. I'm not as fascinated by the dark side of life, as I was. I could look at it without emotion, but...
I think that there is no doubt that the younger you are the easier it is to change. And you're right, a total personality overhaul is not very likely. After I wrote the post, I realized that this...
Thanks for that distinction. Even though I know the proper definition of introvert/extrovert, I still tend to think of extroversion as being the same as being gregarious. I can act very extroverted,...
I support the death penalty for someone who commits murder or if they show clear intent that can be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. AND, this would include anyone who plans to murder someone (e.g....
When I take a personality test, I frequently second guess myself by thinking, is that how I really am or is that how I would like to be?. Sometimes it's not that clear to me.   I'm an introvert,...
I haven't heard of the first two. Eddy Izzard is fun. I liked his show The Riches. I was weened on Monty Python, so dry, sarcastic and irreverent British funny does strike a chord with me. I don't...
Sunflower: Your thoughtful reply to all the contributors in this threat show that your heart is in the right place. But, your mind may not be. Maybe I'm just being too semantic, but your phasing...
Yes, I'm a caterer too, but not as much as I used to be. It was that whole non confrontational thing coupled with the introvert's phobia of dealing with other people's issues. It just seemed a lot...
I can't say that I miss the old me. Part of me was better: I was a little more carefree. And, part of me was worse: I was more insecure about my abilities.   A while back, I read somewhere that if...
Hi:  I don't mean to intrude, but I just had to add my two cents. I'm an ISTJ and I've been into martial arts for about 23 years now. In that time, I think I've seen most types represented. I would...
Welcome Natalie:  I'm new myself, so I can't give you any advice other than just look around and check out some of the threads for your type. I'm a fan of international relations as well. It was...
Hey Franny Still no avatar, HMMMM:dry: And, what are your interests?
@willmark I can relate to your story 100%. It's true we're all born with a specific temperament , but your character isn't carved in stone. We can all choose our responses to life. It's easier for...
@willmark Are you saying that he does not accept you for how you are? Or he's not the father that you want him to be?
@Hellokittykatt I'm sorry but either he's just not that into you, or he's not an ISTJ. ISTJ's have issues with relationships, but once that door is opened and if the sex is good, we're coming  back...
@Caius20 I didn't expect anyone else to be into MMA, for some reason. Do you participate or spectate?
Major: political science  Work: computer programmer analyst, web developer  Interests: psychology,  geopolitics, history, economics, philosophy, cooking, mma and fma
I chose 4, but it doesn't really fit.   My Dad was an emotionally scarred guy who didn't have a father, and his mother was a total bitch. He was a WW2 refugee who had a hard time fitting into North...
I read an article by Stephen Cannell the big time Hollywood and TV writer, he's a dyslexic like me.  I was looking for some  insight into the creative process. He wrote that early in his career he...
I second Qadosh. Sarcasm used to be my stock and trade. I couldn't tell a joke well, but I was good a what I would call observational sarcasm. I try :blushed: not to be such a smart-ass these days.
Thanks Frannyy: My ex wife used to call me that. I kept the name and lost the wife. I stumbled on a picture of an real un-posed bear contemplating Mt. Fuji. How cool was that, I didn't have to get...
1) Do you get/understand ISTJ humor? Of course   2) Are you amused by ISTJ humor? totally  3) Do you have no idea what I am talking about because ISTJs are boring emotionless people who...
Words of Affirmation would be my primary language, followed closely by physical touching. Serve that up on a combo platter and you are talking my language!:laughing:
funny!!!!!!
Neither a lurker or a shirker be!  Welcome fellow thinking introvert.
Welcome King of Birds: Exactly what kind of Fowl are you?  a raptor, a falconiform? :dry:
I'm a big guy, and I used to intimidate people for some reason. And, I don't think I was arrogant either, but I got that one a lot too, from people who didn't know me. I'm an introvert, who doesn't...
Hey JC:  Welcome!   I haven't been around that long but, there seems to be a lot of interesting people on this site, and there are a few you say OMG, it's a good thing they're on the other end...
Somehow, I don't think that's a unique perspective. I, for one, get those feelings all the time. If making a connection were easy we'd all have thousands of friends and be in love all the time. ...'
